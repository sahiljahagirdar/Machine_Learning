"I think Ba***ds of Bollywood is one of the best Bollywood shows I‚Äôve watched this year. I say this NO exaggeration!!! It was so refreshing, satirical, full of Easter eggs and references, ironic humour and honestly felt like a big middle finger to everyone who keeps making fun of the Bollywood industry. It felt like an ‚Äúin your face, bitches‚Äù statement by Aaryan Khan, and I LOVED it. IT IS TRUE ENTERTAINMENT!!!

Watching the show through the eyes of someone who actually grew up in the industry felt fresh and new. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect it to be as good as it genuinely turned out to be.

The performances were absolutely nailed by the cast. Lakshaye Lalwani, as always, was outstanding in his role as Aasmaan. His portrayal of an ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù actor finally getting his big break and then navigating the glamorous yet cutthroat, politically charged world of Bollywood was truly impressive. But the real highlight was the friendship between Aasmaan and Parvez (played by Raghav). Their bond felt so natural and effortless, with the kind of best friend chemistry that instantly draws you in. And Raghav‚Äôs comedic timing? Absolutely unbelievable!!!!
Sahher Bambba was amazing as Karishma Talwar, a nepo kid trying to find her way in the industry. The way her character balanced the privileges of a silver spoon with the struggles it brings was so well done. Bobby Deol, like the fine wine that he is, was a treat to watch, along with Anya Singh, Mona Singh, and Manoj Pahwa, all of whom played their characters with finesse.

Even the cameos were a delight. Big actors showing up for just a glimpse made it so much fun. It was especially nice to see Rajat Bedi (as Jaraj Saxena) back on screen after forever; I last remember him from Koi Mil Gaya and nowhere after that!

Despite the many characters and subplots, the pacing was tight and engaging. The show had hilarious moments, brainrot worthy bits, slick action sequences, and even car chases. The dialogues, songs, and background score were top notch too.

And that plot twist in the last episode, OH. MY. GOD. The twists were twisting in ways I didn‚Äôt see coming, and the ending was just such an unexpected yet brilliant way to close things off.

Overall, Ba****ds of Bollywood is a solid A. It‚Äôs fun, refreshing, well made, and absolutely worth your time. If you‚Äôve always loved Bollywood, this one‚Äôs for you. Aaryan Khan truly SERVED US with this one!!!",1
"Absolutely loved this series. I enjoyed every bit of it from start to finish. The storyline was engaging, the characters were well-written, and the emotional depth really hit home.

Imran Hashmi‚Äôs entry was simply awesome. His presence brought a whole new energy to the show and he nailed every scene he was in. Raghav Juyal‚Äôs performance was another standout. I was honestly blown away by how good he was. His acting felt so real and intense, it added a lot of weight to the story.

I also want to appreciate all the actors who brought their characters to life so well. Each one added something unique to the story, making the series even more captivating.

The climax was something else. The twist about the main character falling in love with his stepsister was bold and unexpected. It was handled in a way that made you feel the emotional conflict without making it uncomfortable. It added a powerful layer to the whole narrative.

What I really appreciated was how the series gave a fresh take compared to typical Bollywood reality shows. It didn‚Äôt follow the usual predictable formulas and instead brought something unique and real, which made it stand out in a sea of similar content.

From my perspective, this series truly stands out because of its bold storytelling and strong performances. The way it mixes emotional depth with unexpected twists keeps the audience fully engaged. It‚Äôs refreshing to see a show that doesn‚Äôt shy away from complex themes and delivers them with sincerity. The chemistry between the actors and the well-crafted narrative really make it memorable.

Honestly, I‚Äôm already looking forward to the second series. This story has so much potential, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next in part two. Hopefully, it comes out soon because I‚Äôm definitely ready for more!

Overall, this series was a complete package. Great performances, strong writing, and a storyline that keeps you thinking even after it ends. I‚Äôm really glad I watched it and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"From Sri Lanka!
I absolutely loved the series. It was so entertaining! The first few epis were hilarious and genuinely funny. There are also clever hints that seem to point directly at certain people (you know who).

Regarding the cast, from the main characters to the supporting characters, everyone did a fantastic job. I especially enjoyed Raghav Juyal‚Äôs comic moments. He really showed how versatile he is as an actor. His pairing with Lakshya Lalwani was perfect, like two peas in a pod. Both of them were brilliant, and the same goes for the rest of the cast, from leads to supporting roles. Senior actors like Bobby Deol and Manoj Pahwa were brilliant too.

The biggest highlight for me was the cameos. They were awesome. None of them felt forced or unnecessary. I also felt the series leaned into dark comedy at times, which was refreshing. Plus, it revealed certain behind-the-scenes truths about the movie industry that audiences rarely get to see. I only wish they had carried that thread through till the end.

Story-wise, it‚Äôs not perfect, but it honestly exceeded my expectations. I didn‚Äôt expect something this good from Aryan and his team. As a newcomer, he really nailed how to make people laugh (which is funny, since he rarely shows it on his own face). The dialogues were another highlight; sharp, witty, and hilarious.

Overall, this series is a must-watch for me. I‚Äôm definitely going to rewatch it, because I love to laugh, and it‚Äôs rare for a Hindi show to make me laugh this much, without feeling forced or overdone.",1
"Man, I watched the entire Bads of Bollywood* and in one word ‚Äî totally entertaining! A young director creating something like this is so impressive. I‚Äôm still laughing while writing this review. The way he handled some real issues of Bollywood in a comic way was just brilliant ‚Äî like that drug raid üòÇ officer scene, man! And in such a fun way, he also raised the point about how outsiders are treated in Bollywood. You can think of doing things your own way, but you can‚Äôt actually do it your way, because Bollywood looks glamorous from the outside but is too dark from the inside.

The cinematography was good, and of course, the colouring was done by Red Chillies Entertainment, so no doubt it was brilliant. The songs may not be all-time chartbuster type, but they were well used in the series. The screenplay was excellent üëå, and there‚Äôs an unexpected twist in the story that will leave you in shock and completely change the whole plot.

There are cameos of so many Bollywood stars ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to give spoilers, but trust me, one cameo will blow your mind! And the actors have all given their best. Every single one of them was outstanding. But if I have to give a shoutout to someone, it would be Raghav Juyal and Manoj Pahwa sir and Manish Chaudhary as Freddy.

Point to be noted ‚Äî Karan Johar didn‚Äôt just make a cameo appearance; he is in the full series, and his role was very important! The lead actor Lakshya was outstanding, man. Sahher Bambba is the new crush of B-Town, and Anya Singh as the manager was just WOW! The way Bobby Deol sir was represented in this series will remind you of the young Bobby Deol, and Mona ma‚Äôam, as always, was the cherry on the cake.

So overall, it was a highly entertaining web series that showcased the dark side of Bollywood in a comic way.

My personal rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5",1
"""The Bads of Bollywood""* is a spectacular and long-overdue satirical take on the Hindi film industry. Created and directed by Aryan Khan, this series is a fearless and hilarious look at the glitzy yet often absurd world of movies, with a razor-sharp script that consistently delivers on its promise of an inside-out expos√©. It's a show that will not only entertain avid Bollywood fans but also offer a compelling and insightful peek for those unfamiliar with the industry's inner workings.
From the very first episode, the series establishes a tone that is both goofy and deeply self-aware. It masterfully uses humor to tackle serious subjects, including nepotism, star-power, and the constant media scrutiny that plagues the industry. The writing is the show's biggest strength, filled with clever Easter eggs, witty dialogues, and moments of self-deprecating humor that are a joy to witness. It's a tight and well-paced narrative that never loses its footing.
The casting is an absolute triumph. While the star-studded cameos are a delightful surprise and add to the show's meta-humor, it is the core cast that truly makes the series shine. The lead performances are nothing short of brilliant, bringing authenticity and heart to their characters. They are perfectly cast for their roles, and their chemistry is palpable, making their journey‚Äîfrom ambitious newcomers to navigating industry chaos‚Äîfeel incredibly real and relatable.
Technically, the show is a visual treat. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the glamour of showbiz while also using a unique visual style to enhance the storytelling. The music is equally outstanding, adding layers to the scenes and serving as a crucial part of the narrative.
What sets ""The Ba***ds of Bollywood"" apart is its courage to mock itself and its world. It is a bold, confident, and unapologetically entertaining series that proves a well-written script, strong direction, and excellent performances can create a true masterpiece. It is, without a doubt, one of the best shows of the year and a must-watch on Netflix.",1

"Movie Review: *The Bds of Bollywood***
Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (4/5)

I hope there is no spoilers in this review 

The B**ds of Bollywood is a lively comedy-drama that captures the chaos, humor, and emotions of the film industry with wit and heart.

The cast shines brightly: Bobby Deol commands attention with his seasoned presence, Lakshya adds sincerity and freshness, and Mona as Lakshya‚Äôs mother delivers such warmth and depth that you will definitely remember her performance. Manoj Pahwa once again proves why he‚Äôs one of the finest character actors, bringing effortless comedy. And of course, Raghav Juyel is the true scene-stealer ‚Äî his quirky style, natural humor, and charisma make him unforgettable.

Credit also goes to director Aryan Khan, who makes a fantastic debut. His direction is stylish, confident, and surprisingly mature for a first film, marking him as one of the most promising debutant directors in Bollywood.

The story keeps you entertained with its blend of laughs and emotions, and the climax is staged on such a grand scale that it will ‚Äî at least once ‚Äî remind you of Game of Thrones, though with a lighter, more playful touch.

Overall, The B**ds of Bollywood is a smart, entertaining 4/5 watch ‚Äî powered by strong performances and Aryan Khan‚Äôs impressive directorial debut.",1
"The series ¬∞The Ba***ds of Bollywood¬∞ speaks truth in every breathing moment - yes, added with humour in places, one may not expect ~ Raghav genuinely has taken the show and his talent on a different level. What I loved the most is honesty ~ raw & brutal, and the multi-zillion inspirations taken from a longggggg list of industry realities. Creativity truly taken a different turn with this series. Every fiction stems from some contextual facts and this series is an ode to that. I love how so, so, so, so many little incidents, situations, experiences from an array of bollywood lives have been weaved so meticulously. I felt this series to be a perfect amalgamation of Madhur Bhandarkar & Farah Khan (') taste of direction and story writing. Fully Indian masala, truth embedded and sewed in entertainment.  One blank that I felt in the role played by Bobby Deol - it could have been portrayed in a different light solely because this gentleman is a superb actor and has proved his mettal and might in both Ashram & Animal - hence showcasing him as the bad man is something that has been already massively seen so that is one place which I feel could be something different; or, if one could portray them in a much evilier form which I am sure bollywood in reality has. This was like Bobby's upped game in villainous roles was much much milder here. If there ever comes a season 2 then definitely his role needs to shine atop as the most villainous else it would be a bad usage of his talent. 
Another flaw was the way both Asmaan & Karishma met at the end in the coffee shop - this scene seemed to be in a rush and there was no actual emotional angel to it, but definitely the last line by the actor, ""Rakhi pe milenge"" was funny but not hahah hillarious.
Loved how every *special appearance* actor in their 10 to 30 seconders were put in various places. I maybe wrong, but I felt a lot of emotional struggle stories were taken as is from Siddhant Chaturvedi, Shanaya Kapoor and Ananya Pandey's real life spaces. Except the last ~ episode 7, other episodes were normally portrayed which also showed a lot of underlinning simplicity under so so so so much glamour. Few thing, I still am curious about is
Q ""Why Ajay's son so against his whole familiar?"" 
Q ""Why did Gautami made the statement, 'there is a difference between being in love and being married'!""
That is a mystery; I mean one can assume a lot of reason, but it would be fun to see the 'whys' if there is a season 2. And at the end of all this ~ I super liked how even with so much glamour, big stars, et al; the humane emotions kept flowing in every scene, in between the dialogues, it felt real and genuinely very middle class; funnily even when they show the families in such huge mansions; retaining that at the end of the day, everyone is a normal person - even the actors. Certainly everyone, every single actor has done a brilliant job of showcasing their craft and talent of *ACTING* - this credit surely goes to the Director hands down. One of the raremost until now where the series outbid its promotions; specifically in today's world where promotions show a lot of promise and then the actual product is absolute blah. Congratulations and all the best to each and every person who gave their bit to this series. 
For me the rating is somewhere between 3 & 4 however I did not have the option of rating something in between.
Blessings and Healings üôè",1
"The Bads of Bollywood ‚Äì Web Series Review*

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5)
Platform: Hyder Talks
Episodes: 7

Review:
The Bad*s of Bollywood on Hyder Talks is a wild ride through the glamorous yet chaotic world of the film industry, packed with humor, drama, and unexpected twists.

Episodes 1‚Äì3:
The opening episodes are highly engaging, filled with sharp humor, clever dialogues, and strong character introductions. Raghav Juyal and Lakshya Lalwani share fantastic on-screen chemistry, bringing comic relief and energy to every scene. The satire on Bollywood‚Äôs inner workings keeps things light yet intriguing.

Episode 6:
This episode takes a bold turn, exploring complex and often messy relationships. It crosses certain emotional and moral lines, keeping viewers glued to the screen as the story delves into darker, more complicated themes.

Climax (Episode 7):
The final episode delivers an unpredictable twist, blending comedy with drama and leaving viewers surprised till the very end. It ties together the humor, relationships, and mystery in a satisfying way, though some might feel it could have gone even deeper with the behind-the-scenes revelations.


Performances:
The cast shines throughout, with standout performances from Raghav Juyal, Lakshya Lalwani, Bobby Deol, and Manoj Pahwa. Cameos are a delightful surprise, never feeling forced or unnecessary.

Verdict:
With witty dialogues, engaging storytelling, and a mix of comedy and drama, The Bad*s of Bollywood on Hyder Talks is an entertaining watch. It‚Äôs a must-see for anyone who enjoys dark comedy, satire, and unpredictable storytelling.",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed watching Raghav and Lakshay as friends in the show, rather than rivals as seen last in ""KILL"". The chemistry and timing between them were impressive. I liked Vijayant Kohli's portrayal of dad, reminiscent of Farooq Shaikh's character from YJHD. Mona Singh was also excellent as the mom with witty comebacks. Anya Singh's character, Sanya, was a highlight among all the characters in the movie, and she played it to perfection. 

Then comes the veterans - Bobby Deol, Manoj Pahwa and Manish Chaudhari. They took the series to a whole new level, subtly exposing the facade behind the glam of the film industry. Rajat bedi (use kahin toh dekha hai :-) ) 

Aryan Khan, the director, is definitely someone to watch out for. He has skillfully used his star kid status to his advantage, rather than relying on it. Celebrity cameos, we have seen many a times in other films and movies but the way he has woven them as a part of narrative is truly seamless. I'm excited to see more good work from this talented young director. As this is just the beginning and ""picture abhi baki hai dost"".  

Well, if you haven't already watched it what are you waiting for?",1
"The film/webseries is 5 hours long but still it is not boring , I really enjoyed watching the movie for the first 4 hours atleast . The last twist was good ,,,üòÉ Finally heroine ko behan bana hi diya kisi film mein, dushri filmo mein heroine behan bante bante nehi banti üòÉüòÉ .The chemistry between Raghav and Lakshya is superb with Raghav win the hearts as the best supporting actor in a comic role . This guy is multi-talented be it dancing or be it hosting , be a comedian or be a villain , he is good in his every damn role . The film contains so many faces but yet it didn't become haphazard. Aryan Khan did a brilliant job , we all have seen him in the trailer and it is clearly visible he gives quite similar vibes like his father and even he is expressive that many of the new gen actors like his father . His father is a hardworking person and his work reflects the same .  Kudos to the entire team of the film and specially the one from Aryan the entire idea itself need lots of thought process .",1
"No words just speechless. I just finished watching Aryan Khan‚Äôs debut series The Bads of Bollywood and wow‚Äîwhat a ride! This isn‚Äôt your typical glossy Bollywood drama; it‚Äôs a sharp, bold, and unapologetic satire that pulls you straight into the madness of the industry.

From the very first episode, I was hooked by its chaotic energy and clever digs at real-life scandals. The cameos are insane‚Äîevery few minutes a superstar walks in, and yet it never feels forced. Raghav Juyal absolutely stole every scene he was in, and Emraan Hashmi‚Äôs cameo with him? Pure gold.

What I loved most was how self-aware the show is. Aryan doesn‚Äôt just poke fun at Bollywood, he even turns the mirror on himself, referencing his own controversies with surprising honesty and humor. That takes guts.

Of course, it‚Äôs not perfect‚Äîthe pacing dips here and there, and some jokes stretch a bit too long‚Äîbut overall the series is entertaining, gutsy, and full of moments that had me laughing out loud.

Aryan Khan has made a debut that is fearless, filmy, and fun. If you‚Äôre a Bollywood fan who enjoys drama, satire, and plenty of star power, this is a must-watch.

‚≠ê My rating: 4/5 ‚Äì for its boldness, brilliant cameos, and unapologetic style.",1
"Badass of Bollywood is a series that lives up to its name‚Äîfull of swagger, drama, and those fun, unpredictable twists that keep you binge-watching. It‚Äôs like a cocktail of everything we love about Bollywood: the style, the attitude, the larger-than-life moments, and just the right pinch of madness.

What really stands out is Aryan Khan‚Äôs work. For a debut, he‚Äôs done a stellar job in bringing this edgy, bold vision to life. The storytelling feels fresh, slick, and unapologetically filmy‚Äîexactly the kind of experiment Bollywood fans have been waiting for.

The series isn‚Äôt about perfection; it‚Äôs about vibe. And the vibe here is pure entertainment with a badass punch. Drama, glamour, action, and a dash of wit‚Äîit‚Äôs all mixed in just right.

Kudos to Aryan Khan for pulling off something this ambitious. The future of Bollywood storytelling feels exciting with voices like his stepping in.

But so many stars present and the credit no doubtebly goes to the Badshah of Bollywood none other than Shah Rukh Khan.‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"B***** of Bollywood* turned out to be a complete surprise package. Aryan Khan‚Äôs first outing as a director is sharp, fearless, and way more polished than anyone could have imagined. He‚Äôs managed to blend satire, quirky humor, and dark undertones into a story that feels fresh and entertaining from start to finish. The pacing is crisp, the music works, and the writing has enough bite to keep you hooked.

The casting is spot-on‚ÄîLakshya Lalwani and Raghav Juyal share fantastic chemistry and deliver some of the funniest scenes, while Imran Hashmi‚Äôs entry lifts the energy instantly. Veterans like Bobby Deol and Manoj Pahwa add depth, and the cameos are clever, never forced.

What really stands out is Aryan‚Äôs confidence behind the camera. He‚Äôs taken a risky subject and turned it into something fun, stylish, and surprisingly layered. For a debut, this is a huge win. Definitely worth a binge.",1
"It appears there's a recent web series or movie called The Ba*ds of Bollywood, directed by Aryan Khan. Here's a review based on what's being discussed:
The Ba*ds of Bollywood has been a buzz-worthy project, largely due to its director, Aryan Khan. The series is a mixed bag, offering some entertaining moments but also falling into familiar and ""seen-before"" tropes of the film industry.
What Works:
 * Meta Humor and Tributes: The series is filled with self-referential jokes and ""meta humor"" that seem to be a hit with audiences, particularly Gen Z. It includes nods to iconic moments from Shah Rukh Khan's career and makes fun of the industry's stereotypes.
 * Cameos: High-profile cameos from stars like Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and others are a major draw. Shah Rukh's appearance is particularly noted as a highlight.
 * Performances: The supporting cast, including Manoj Pahwa and Mona Singh, have been praised for their performances. Bobby Deol's role has also been a pleasant surprise for many viewers.
 * Insider's Perspective: The series attempts to give an inside look at the Bollywood industry, addressing topics like nepotism, the ""movie mafia,"" and the pressures of fame.
What Doesn't Work:
 * Tonal Confusion: Some critics point out a confusion in the series' tone. It's unclear whether it's genuinely satirizing the industry or simply using stereotypes to tell a predictable story.
 * Predictable Plot: The story is stretched out over seven episodes and often feels like a collection of cliches. Many feel it could have been a much tighter film. The main narrative lacks a compelling arc and can be tedious to watch at times.
 * Over-reliance on Cameos: While the cameos are a highlight, some argue that the series heavily relies on them and other self-digs to compensate for a weak script and uninspired storytelling.
 * Weak Writing: The screenplay is often criticized for being sluggish, with dialogues that are not always effective. The humor, while appreciated by some, is seen as dated and not ""self-aware"" enough by others.
Overall:
The Ba*ds of Bollywood is a series that aims for a sharp, satirical take on the Hindi film industry. While it succeeds in parts, particularly with its insider jokes and high-profile cameos, it often falls short due to a weak, overstretched plot and a lack of a clear, coherent vision. It's the kind of show that will likely appeal to fans who enjoy ""brain rot"" cinema‚Äîa term used by some to describe content that is nonsensical but fun to watch due to its outrageous and illogical nature. If you're looking for a serious, well-crafted drama, this might not be it, but if you're in the mood for a fun, over-the-top ride with plenty of insider references, it might be worth a watch.",1
"The Ba**ds of Bollywood was an absolute delight to watch! From start to finish, it kept me hooked without a single dull moment. The way it blends satire, comedy, and drama to showcase the glamour, politics, and egos of Bollywood feels fresh and highly entertaining.
Aryan Khan‚Äôs direction is outstanding ‚Äî stylish visuals, sharp dialogues, and great use of music make the series shine. The cast delivered solid performances, especially Lakshya Lalwani, Saher Bambba, and Bobby Deol. And of course, the cameos by Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, and Ranbir Kapoor took it to another level.
What I loved most is that beyond the entertainment, the series also reflects on some real issues within the film industry in a witty way.
If you love Bollywood, this series is a must-watch. For me, it‚Äôs one of the best shows Netflix has offered recently and has instantly become a favorite.",1
"The Ba*****s of Bollywood (The B**.o.B.) is a refresher amidst the chaos of 'sex and bloodbath only' content. It has tashan and jashan about Bollywood at equal level. Sometimes it takes jabs at B-Town, while sometimes it shows its vulnerable moments. We expect Red Chillies Entertainment to bring us a top product and they had delivered as always. From the very begining to the very end, all actors have performed their heat out with ease. Most of them are experienced actors and they live upto their reputations. And the newcomers also shine bright. Debutant writer/director Aryan has done very good job along with his fellow creatives to bring a banger. The special effects department has done amazing job. Especially in the opening montage when , Aasmaan does his stunt and is mid-way through air. That was flexing of their abilities to do VFX and rightfully so. Kudos to editors for apt cuts and saving audience's time. All music pieces hit the heart well and fine. And the cameos are like cherry on the cake. Now the question is, if this series gets another season, who we can expect next to appear? But before that let's hope for a second season. Especially because now we know the well kept secret and wants to know more about what happens with our hero and his gang. And in case you haven't watched this series and wondering what you just read, just go and watch and have a nice time.",1

At the same time, the lead actors Lakshya Lalwani and Sahher Bambba are earning appreciation for their chemistry and for bringing a fresh outsider‚Äôs perspective to the story.

Overall, audiences are calling it ‚Äúfilmy, fun, and engaging,‚Äù with polished visuals and a glamorous presentation. Social media reactions suggest people are excited and see it as a promising start for Aryan Khan as a director.",1
"Incredible show I've ever watched,
The cameos ,
And the background score ,
Aryan Khan is the greatest director in young age, raghav and lakshay, and mouna, and Manoj pahwa, rajat bedi , and sahher bammba was cute and adorable. And dialogues and punchlines is good. Full of sense of humor,
And comedy and action.
And storyline was masterstroke,
Bobby deol as negative role after animal was brilliant he is still savage ,
This types of series , and movies can be the comeback of Bollywood same as late 19s,
Every cameos is amazing including ranbir ,salman, and srk, aamir , raja mouli,ranvir,
Baadshah, and also arshad warsi,
What a series deserve and oscar as well as director and actors. At the last how new comer struggle to get films watch every second of this film is worth watching it may made you day happy.",1
"Well, I was waiting for this series to be released and have seen it within 24 hours. Being an SRKIAN, have seen Aryan growing and with his directorial debut, he presented an awesome creation which has all the masala of bollywood films.
A struggling actor got a chance in a big banner film and his journey to establish himself in the industry, and if you think this is the one liner, oh God, you are mistaken.
This story has a wonderful twist at the end which would make you feel awestruck.
The ensemble cast of the series was absolutely in tone with their respective characters.
Lakshya and Sahher looked glamorous yet tender. Manoj Pahwa and Mona Singh seemed to be perfect choice. Raghav Juyal was absolutely magnificent with his timing of delivery. Anya Singh, Rajat Bedi(seen him after long time), Manish Choudhary (with typical stylish negativity) had justice to their characters.
Though the quick relationship between the hero and heroine and their understanding, I felt, could have been portrayed with bit patience. The typical illogicality of Masala movies(Thank God), is almost absent in the series.
And yes Bobby Deol, was flawlessly acted with an undertone and won my üíú heart.
KJ acted as KJ and with his inimitable style and smartness. Arshad Warsi as Gafoor Bhai acted as per his standards.

Aryan, you have created a popular and wonderful series where audience will definitely enjoy thoroughly, you brilliantly weaved nepotism vs outsider issue. You smartky mocked over the drug police (NCB or whatever) and presented a wonderful and feel good series for us.

Ohh didn't I write a word about SRK?
Nothing to write Badshah, your presence in the screen makes the day of billions. Love you always...Loved to watch SS Rajamouli, Aamir Khan, Ranbir Singh, Ranbir Kapoor and ofcourse Tamalli Maya Eemran Hashmi in and as themselves.

Waiting for the next season... What Freddy and Jaraj will plot against Arjun and his family üòâ??",1
"The Bads of Bollywood is a complete entertainer! From start to finish, it‚Äôs a perfect mix of drama, comedy, glamour, and raw emotions. Aryan Khan‚Äôs debut as a creator truly shines ‚Äî the storytelling feels fresh, bold, and full of energy.

The series beautifully captures the highs and lows of Bollywood, with sharp satire and inside jokes that every movie lover will enjoy. Performances are outstanding, especially Lakshya as Aasmaan, who delivers both charm and depth. The supporting cast adds extra sparkle, and every cameo feels like a treat.

What I loved most is the balance ‚Äî it‚Äôs fun, flashy, and over-the-top when needed, but also heartfelt and relatable in emotional moments. The visuals, dialogues, and the overall vibe make it binge-worthy in every sense.

For me, this is one of the best web series of the year. Truly a must-watch for anyone who loves cinema and wants to see a new side of Bollywood.",1
"A Self-Aware Satire with an Insider's Edge""The Bads of Bollywood,"" directed by Aryan Khan, is a satirical comedy-drama that dives into the chaotic and often absurd world of the Hindi film industry. The series follows an aspiring actor and his friends as they navigate the industry's glamorous facade and its murky underbelly.

The show's main strength is its self-awareness and insider humor. It's filled with meta-references and celebrity cameos, including appearances from Shah Rukh Khan, Karan Johar, and Ranbir Kapoor, which add a layer of authenticity and fun. The series takes playful jabs at everything from nepotism debates to media scrutiny, often recreating viral moments from real life for a knowing audience. For those who follow Bollywood closely, these references are a major highlight and a source of genuine laughter.

However, this insider approach is also its biggest weakness. For viewers not steeped in Bollywood gossip and culture, many of the jokes and nuances might fall flat. The narrative can feel disjointed and, at times, struggles to find its footing between sharp satire and a more conventional, dramatic storyline. While some critics have lauded the show as a fresh and bold debut, others have found it to be a mixed bag, relying too heavily on its meta-commentary rather than a compelling, standalone plot.

Ultimately, ""The Bads of Bollywood"" is a project clearly made by someone who knows the industry inside and out. It's a show that will likely be a treat for die-hard Bollywood fans who appreciate the self-deprecating humor and clever nods, but it may not resonate as strongly with a wider, more general audience.",1
"Hilarious and witty take by Aryan Khan (son of Shah Rukh Khan) in his directorial web series debut. He exposes the inner workings and some negative shade of Bollywood industry in a unique way. 
Bobby Deol as the macho man stands up tall. Lakshya as the protagonist enacts well with ease. Sahher as another main lead is apt. 
All cameos have nailed it- be it the comic timing between Amir khan & Rajamouli, to face palm moment of Shah Rukh khan scenes, to voila jakaas moment with Arshad Warsi. 
This web series has a proper story, action, comedy and takes you through an emotional ride. The climax comes with a side splitting and surprising twist that no one can guess. 
A complete paisa vasool entertainer!
Not to be missed on Netflix!",1
"The Bads of Bollywood is generating buzz for being bold, flashy, and unapologetically entertaining. Viewers are especially enjoying how it pokes fun at the industry itself ‚Äî from nepotism to scandals ‚Äî with a sharp, self-aware edge.

Aryan Khan‚Äôs directorial debut is being praised as confident and stylish, with audiences noting his engaging storytelling, slick production values, and eye for spectacle. The series also leans into star power, featuring cameos from Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Karan Johar, and more ‚Äî a lineup that fans say adds irresistible charm.

At its core, though, the show rests on the fresh pairing of Lakshya Lalwani and Sahher Bambba. Their chemistry and ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù perspective have struck a chord, balancing the glamour with authenticity.

Overall, audiences are calling The Bads of Bollywood ‚Äúfilmy, fun, and engaging‚Äù ‚Äî a polished, high-gloss ride that signals a promising start for Aryan Khan as a filmmaker.",1
"Started watching it late last night,  without much expectation at the beginning. Just thought it was a directorial debut of a son of a super famous dad ( born with a silver spoon ! ) trying his hand at something new .  The dad we were crazy about since his ""Fauji"" and ""Circus""  days . 
I just wanted to give the son the benefit of doubt and see his capability. 
I could not stop myself from binge watching the episodes till 2 a.m . Finished watching the last episode today. 
Kudos to Aryan Khan , the new director : 
A new subject 
Good script 
Amazing acting by the new actors as well as the older ones  .
Hilarious take on Bollywood & ""Bollywood Nepotism "" ;  Bollywood and the underworld ;  subtle references to Me too ,  Drugs , Three -film -contracts /deals; changing loyalties , back- biting fake opportunistic people ,etc. 

Bobby Deol ( whose acting I like more now than in the 1990s , especially after Ashram ) , Manoj Pahwa , Mona Singh ( our favourite Jassi ) were great as usual. Arshad Warsi , Karan Johar , Ranveer Singh , Ranbir Kapoor in their special appearances spiced up the preparation. 
Overall , great going Aryan.  Keep it up. You proved that being born with a silver spoon does not necessarily bring you success or fame.  
Will definitely wait for the next season.",1
"I absolutely loved this show! Aryan Khan has delivered a stellar performance, and the leads shine brilliantly throughout. Bobby Deol‚Äôs presence adds an electrifying spark, keeping the energy high every time he appears on screen.

The storyline is gripping like a roller coaster ride that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The direction is top-notch, pulling together an incredible ensemble of well-established stars and giving each their moment to shine.

Everything feels larger than life: the acting, the background score, the songs, the visuals, it‚Äôs all nothing short of amazing. This series is a complete cinematic experience, and I‚Äôm enjoying every bit of it.

I highly recommend it to everyone.. it‚Äôs a must-watch!",1
"‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (5/5)

The Bads of Bollywood is an absolute must-watch! The show perfectly blends satire, drama, and comedy while exposing the darker, more complex side of the film industry. The storytelling feels fresh and engaging, with strong performances by Lakshya Lalwani, Sahher Bambba, and the ever-powerful Bobby Deol.

The writing is sharp, the production quality is top-notch, and every episode keeps you hooked till the end. The cameos by Bollywood legends, especially the three Khans, are the cherry on top and add extra excitement for fans.

Aryan Khan has done a fantastic job in his directorial debut‚Äîthis series proves he‚Äôs here to stay. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys bold storytelling, powerful performances, and a fresh perspective on the glam world of Bollywood.",1
"While many critics have written off this series as a misfire, I found it to be exactly what it set out to be: a bona fide entertainer. From episode to episode, the show maintains a flow that keeps you invested, making it remarkably easy to binge. It strikes the right balance of emotion, action, and romance, creating a narrative rhythm that sustains audience engagement.

What‚Äôs particularly compelling is the way the series weaves in the ever-present conversation around nepotism, offering a fleeting but honest glimpse behind the glossy fa√ßade of the film industry‚Äîwhether on the silver screen or its digital counterpart. Rather than presenting itself as high art, the series embraces cinema‚Äôs primary role: to entertain. Judging by the popularity it has garnered, it‚Äôs safe to say it succeeded.

Some detractors have accused the production of inflating its ratings through aggressive PR. To me, such criticism feels less like objective analysis and more like an attempt to drag down a project that has clearly resonated with audiences. Anyone familiar with the realities of film and series production knows that success isn‚Äôt just about artistic vision‚Äîit also hinges on marketability and return on investment. This series demonstrates strength on both fronts.

As for the naysayers, one wonders whether they could create something of this scale themselves. After all, in today‚Äôs world, anyone with a phone and YouTube has the platform to put their vision to the test. Until then, dismissing a series that delivers on its promise of entertainment seems more like noise than critique.",1
"Been a while since I watched something this good and engaging. üëåüëç
Bads of Bollywood shows the real side of the film industry, and the best part is that it‚Äôs presented in a totally filmy, dramatic way. 

What I loved most is how it balances truth with entertainment. It never feels dull‚Äîthere‚Äôs drama, suspense, and some raw reality that usually stays hidden. At times it feels like you‚Äôre watching a full-on Bollywood thriller, not just a series.

You get the glamour, the controversies, and even the dark corners of Bollywood‚Äîall wrapped up in a style that keeps you hooked.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Someone curious about the unseen truth of Bollywood, this one is a must watch.üëçüëå

 Verdict: Totally binge-worthy!",1
"Aryan Khan‚Äôs debut directorial, The Ba*ds of Bollywood, is a bold, witty, and full-on entertaining ride through the heart and chaos of the Hindi film industry. Loved the sharp screenplay, punchy dialogues, and outstanding performances by Bobby Deol, Lakshya, Raghav Juyal, Sahher Bambba, and a host of guest stars. Special mention to Bilal Siddiqui and Manav Chauhan for their top-notch writing, and the music team (Shashwat Sachdev, Anirudh Ravichander, Arijit Singh, Raja Kumari, Badshah, and more) for a vibrant and energetic soundtrack. The cameos are great fun and the satire is refreshingly self-aware, especially for Bollywood fans. If you enjoy masala drama with heart, comedy, and clever insider references, this is a must-watch! Highly recommended for anyone wanting a fresh, clever take on Bollywood. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",1
"I absolutely loved this series! It was so good that I ended up watching it in one go. The acting, cast, and dialogues were excellent ‚Äî each character felt real and engaging. The humor was spot-on, making it hilarious at just the right moments, while still being gripping enough to keep me hooked throughout.

A special mention to Aryan Khan ‚Äî for his very first outing as a director, he‚Äôs done a fabulous job. The storytelling, execution, and pace reflect a mature vision, and I‚Äôm excited to see what more he brings in the future.

Definitely a must-watch!",1
Bads of the Bollywood is a refreshing surprise that kept me engaged from start to finish. The story feels innovative and the way it highlights the different shades of characters makes it entertaining and thought provoking at the same time. The performances are strong and every actor brings individuality and impact to their roles. What I really appreciated was the balance between drama and light moments which made the film enjoyable without being overwhelming. The direction is confident and the music complements the mood beautifully. Overall this movie delivers a great cinematic experience and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys meaningful yet entertaining films.,1
"One of the best series I‚Äôve ever watched!

I‚Äôve seen many series with a huge number of characters, and in most of them my mind gets stuck trying to recognize the stars and cast. But in this series, since I‚Äôm already familiar with all the Bollywood stars and actors, I could watch it with ease and comfort.

Hats off to Aryan Khan‚Äîit‚Äôs truly a proud moment for Shah Rukh and Gauri Khan.

At the same time, full credit goes to the actors as well. Every performance was outstanding, and their dedication brought Aryan‚Äôs vision to life so beautifully. The cast truly gave their best, making the series even more powerful and engaging.

God bless you, Aryan. Now, after watching this series, the audience will expect even more from you. Just go with the flow and continue to meet those expectations.",1
"Released on 18th September on Netflix, I finished this series the very next day (19th Sep 2025) in just one go. It has 7 episodes, each around 40‚Äì55 minutes long.

Straight to the point ‚Äì the series is well-written. While watching, I never felt bored, it‚Äôs full-on entertainment. Now, it‚Äôs not like the story is extraordinary, or the comedy, VFX, dialogues, or action are top-notch or unforgettable. But everything feels nicely balanced. Some jokes genuinely made me laugh ‚Äì especially Raghav Juyal and Manoj Pahwa‚Äôs comedy timing and body language. They can really crack up the audience. Even when Manoj Pahwa uses curse words, it feels more like part of his acting than just vulgarity. (But yeah, do keep in mind, there‚Äôs a good amount of swearing in this series.)

Half of Bollywood pops up in one way or another ‚Äì either through scenes, cameos, or dialogues. And even the unnecessary scenes ‚Äì the ones that didn‚Äôt really push the story forward ‚Äì are still written and executed in a way that keeps you hooked. The ending, though? Totally unexpected. I don‚Äôt think many people would have guessed it.

Overall, I‚Äôd say this series is fun. Not a paid or biased review ‚Äì genuinely, while watching, you‚Äôll always find some scene, dialogue, or actor that entertains you. It‚Äôs a solid one-time watch. For me, it‚Äôs a 7/10.",1
"What a solid first step into the directing field by Aryan Khan. Each episode was the perfect length, and hit all the plot points it wanted to cover, but I do think the first few episodes could've been tighter with its pacing. The script and dialogues were a bit clunky and on the nose at times, but overall the show delivered what it wanted to. I do think it relied heavily on being self satirical and meta, along with the very many cameos. The last three episodes make the show worth it for me, the payoff is brilliant! The acting is also honestly good, which is refreshing, both the newcomers and the seasoned actors deliver a good performance. It glorifies the same industry that it set out to criticize, which could be a commentary on what we do and want as an audience. The commercial aspect of it was quite fun, and it's definitely a new sort of show for the general masala bollywood audience. The swearing felt a bit much, almost like trying to carve out an edgier niche. Not the most revolutionary show or idea, but hitting enough to deliver a nice directorial debut. It will be interesting to see what Aryan Khan does next, without plot points centering around mostly referential material. The actors definitely have a bright future ahead. An entertaining watch for sure!",1
"absolutely loved the series. It was so entertaining! The first few epis were hilarious and genuinely funny. There are also clever hints that seem to point directly at certain people 

Regarding the cast, from the main characters to the supporting characters, everyone did a fantastic job. I especially enjoyed Raghav Juyal‚Äôs comic moments. He really showed how versatile he is as an actor. His pairing with Lakshya Lalwani was perfect, like two peas in a pod. Both of them were brilliant, and the same goes for the rest of the cast, from leads to supporting roles. Senior actors like Bobby Deol and Manoj Pahwa were brilliant too.",1
"This web series is an absolute masterpiece! It strikes the perfect balance of drama, comedy, action, and unexpected twists that keep you hooked from start to finish. The storyline flows seamlessly, the characters are brilliantly written, and every episode leaves you wanting more. It‚Äôs rare to find a show that makes you laugh, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and still manages to surprise you at every turn ‚Äî but this one nails it.

Aryan Khan‚Äôs debut as a creator and director is truly impressive. The storytelling is bold, fresh, and full of energy. It gives a raw yet entertaining look at the glamour, struggles, and politics of the film industry. The mix of drama, satire, and comedy kept me hooked through all the episodes.

The performances were strong (special mention to Bobby Deol & Mona Singh), and the cameos added extra spark. The writing felt sharp, and the direction had a unique style that shows Aryan‚Äôs clear vision.

"A Masterclass in Nepo-Lite and Missed Opportunities:

It's always disappointing when a film arrives with massive hype, only to crash and burn under the weight of its own mediocrity. This latest release, directed by none other than Shah Rukh Khan's son, is unfortunately a textbook example of style over substance‚Äîand worse, privilege over talent.

Let‚Äôs get the obvious out of the way: the only positive reviews floating around seem to be straight from the PR team‚Äôs desk. One has to wonder how many lakhs were spent polishing what is essentially a painfully dull and directionless project. For the regular audience, the truth is clear‚Äîthis is less of a cinematic experience and more of a carefully packaged launch vehicle for a star kid who got a platform, not because of merit, but because of a powerful last name.

The acting? Stiff, lifeless, and forgettable. It felt like watching a school play with a big budget. Not one performance stood out for the right reasons. Emotional scenes lacked any real depth, and the chemistry between characters was non-existent. The leads appeared more focused on their camera angles than connecting with the audience.

As for the direction‚ÄîSRK‚Äôs son may have grown up around film sets, but that exposure clearly didn‚Äôt translate into skill. The film is clunky, unevenly paced, and tonally confused. Basic storytelling elements like character development, tension-building, and narrative cohesion are all either missing or poorly executed. There‚Äôs no vision, no voice‚Äîjust a lot of borrowed aesthetics.

Overall, it feels like an expensive demo reel rather than a real film. Sure, it might grab some headlines because of the last names involved, but it won‚Äôt be remembered for its craft. For viewers expecting quality cinema, this is a hard pass.

Save your money, save your time. Let the PR machinery do what it does, but don‚Äôt fall for the hype.",0

"Very well done, Aryan Khan! You have truly exceeded all our expectations. Very interesting, very intelligent story telling. Your attention to detail is just amazing. Did not feel even once that we were watching a series by a first-time director. Excellent screen play, excellent cast - good looking and talented. Witty dialogues. Never a dull moment. Bobby Deol is playing such a wonderfully layered character and he's done full justice to the part. Karan Johar, man, you have guts to play this part despite knowing that you are probably giving more fodder to the trollers! Well done all of you. I binge-watched the series (first in so many years)",1
"It is a very difficult genre to crack, but Aryan Khan executes it with remarkable honesty, showcasing Bollywood in a dark yet hilarious manner that results in iconic comic scenes, many of which will be remembered for a long time. Special mention goes to the choreography and execution of the action scenes, as well as his clever use of flashbacks as a powerful narrative tool, all tied together with outstanding editing patterns. This is, without a doubt, the best series of the year so far. Fingers crossed for a second season, as the finale leaves you with an unfulfilled appetite but a truly satisfying aftertaste.",1
"If you thought Bollywood had already scraped the bottom of the barrel, Aryan Khan just handed you a shovel. The Bads of Bollywood is not only badly named‚Äîit‚Äôs prophetic, because bad is the most generous word you can use for this cinematic catastrophe.

The direction feels like a confused college project masquerading as a film. Scenes drag on endlessly with no sense of rhythm or purpose, dialogue is delivered with all the passion of a robot learning Hindi, and the story‚Äîif you can even call this collection of clich√©s a story‚Äîwanders like a drunk tourist lost in Mumbai traffic.

Khan‚Äôs attempt at ‚Äúedgy filmmaking‚Äù results in nothing more than incoherent montages, awkward silences, and camera angles that suggest the cinematographer either fell asleep or tripped over the tripod. Every character is a cardboard cutout, every emotional beat is telegraphed a mile away, and yet somehow the film still manages to surprise you‚Äîbecause you‚Äôre constantly shocked that it keeps getting worse.

And then there‚Äôs the language. The show shamelessly throws in abusive words at every possible moment‚Äînot because the plot demands it, not because it adds realism, but simply as a cheap trick to grab attention and court controversy. It‚Äôs desperation disguised as dialogue, and it makes the whole thing feel even more hollow.

The random entries of fake Bollywood stars were not only unnecessary, they were distracting and laughable. The only glimmer of talent came from Mona Singh and the elder Yajobi, whose performances showed what real experience looks like‚Äîbut even their efforts are wasted here, buried under the weight of this mess. And of course, the film doesn‚Äôt even bother to give them the respect or space they deserve.

By the end, you‚Äôre not just bored‚Äîyou‚Äôre offended. Offended that your time, your money, and your sanity were sacrificed for this vanity project. The Bads of Bollywood doesn‚Äôt just dishonor cinema; it makes you wonder if Aryan Khan secretly hates audiences.

If this is the future of Bollywood, we should all go back and rewatch the worst 90s melodramas‚Äîthey‚Äôre Oscar-worthy compared to this",0
"Aryan Khan‚Äôs The Ba*ds of Bollywood completely blew my mind. The storytelling is gripping, raw, and unapologetically real.

This show is basically a no-brainer with zero logic; just switch off your brain and enjoy the ride. The scenes are clearly exaggerated on purpose, but honestly, I had fun watching it.

Everyone just comes, delivers a dialogue, and runs away no pause, no feel. Honestly, the sets acted better than the actors, at least they had some depth on screen. One good part was Raghav as Parvaiz he actually looked like a real friend. Funny, supportive, and in tough moments he handled the hero well. That was refreshing. Rest? Exhausting. They keep shouting Bollywood is hell, full of parties, sex, bad company‚Ä¶ but yaar, we already know! Instead of this, I‚Äôd happily watch old Koffee with Karan episodes at least they entertain. And Bobby Deol? 
Still stuck in his Aashram Baba angry-man zone. Bas wahi expression, nothing new.",1

Oh man Aryan you are such a great talent but I have one problem why you show so much gali galoch in this series we know that new generation wants it but we have to give some right path gali galoch should be less not in majority of the time.

The acting is impressive, with Lakshya Lalwani and Raghav Juyal standing out for their strong screen presence. Cameos from top stars add to the appeal, and the glistening production and precise script mean that the series is emotionally and visually satisfying.

What's impressive about this series is Aryan Khan's confident direction. For his first assignment, he shows maturity, √©lan, and ambition. The Ba***ds of Bollywood is not just a debut, it's a declaration ‚Äî and a must-see for anyone who's a fan of smart, entertaining storytelling.",1
"I really enjoyed watching *The Ba***ds of Bollywood* series. It offers a gripping and bold look at the darker, lesser-known side of the industry, with powerful storytelling and engaging performances. The narration style keeps you hooked, and the way it explores the intersections of glamour, crime, and politics is eye-opening and impactful.  

That said, I did not appreciate the segment involving Sameer Wankhede. As a respected Indian Bureaucrat and Indian Revenue Service officer, he deserves recognition for his service to the nation. It felt inappropriate and unnecessary for the series to drag his character profile in a disrespectful way. Highlighting creative and fictional elements is fine, but misrepresenting real individuals in such a manner takes away from the otherwise strong content.  

Overall, the series is highly compelling and worth watching, but I strongly hope in the future that such portrayals are handled with more responsibility and fairness.",1
"Honestly, i feel it was really entertaining and exactly at point connecting with the current generation. Always believed Aryan Khan had talent and honesty it makes me happy that he could prove it with his debut. It‚Äôs always hard for a starkid to prove their worth i am sure. But, the biggest point is in this world not every person makes best use of their opportunities. But Aryan Khan did and that‚Äôs all that makes a difference between a person who wants to contribute to the society and one who is negligent towards it. Because i am sure Aryan did not need to do anything but could have chilled and still had a great life. But he worked and hard work always shows. As an audience of his generation, kudos to you. Our generation is going to create magic if we have people working hard like you. Great work !",1
"Aryan Khan‚Äôs directorial debut is nothing short of impressive. When you know your craft, that‚Äôs one thing but when you‚Äôre gifted and leverage your experience (27 years of practice with None other than SRK) to create something bold, that‚Äôs another.

The Ba***ds of Bollywood is a sharp, satirical take on the madness and glamour of the industry. Don‚Äôt blink you‚Äôll miss his Easter eggs. Every tiny detail feels intentional, from the witty dialogues to the cleverly placed cameos, making it impossible not to binge-watch.

Aryan balances humor, drama, and chaos with surprising maturity for a first-time director. While some tropes feel familiar, the energy, style, and unapologetic storytelling keep it fresh and captivating.

‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
A binge-worthy debut that proves Aryan Khan isn‚Äôt just carrying a legacy. he‚Äôs building his own. 

Why are you still reading this!! Go watch it!! And tell me otherwise‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶",1
"The show definitely was very entertaining. New type of story, very funny moments, action was also really good not like a typical bollywood movie where it‚Äôs overly exaggerated. Definitely a must watch the series was definitely created with alot of thought and effort great job to director Aryan Khan. Looking forward to see what new the generation brings us next we needed something new and authentic like this. Hopefully Aryan can create more in the near future.",1
"Honestly, when I first saw the trailer I wasn't really expecting much. It felt like something a rich kid with papa's money was doing to make use of his time. However, when I didn't have anything to watch on a Friday evening I thought, might as well watch this. 
For the first 10 minutes I thought this was going to be a cringe fest, but it took a turn for the better. Soon, it became entertaining. 
The concept is a mix of a lot of things. Towards the end you'll think, ""yeh toh kahi dekha hai"", and you're right if you have watched some of the prominent movies of that genre. 
The actors have all done a wonderful job. The dialogues aren't cringe, and neither is the acting. A lot of emotions and a lot of genuine acting. You kinda end up liking everyone for the role they have played. There's a lot of Easter eggs, references, all very cleverly put in that makes you giggle if you have been following Bollywood. 
Did I binge the entire thing in one sitting? I pretty much did because it keeps you hooked. The theme and the concept with which the entire show is carried, gives it a nice Bollywood mixed with gen z mode.
Hence, if you're confused if you should watch this, just give it a try.",1
"Now it has come.  But after 3 -4 days of its release there was no perfect review or star ratings on any media, even IMDB. I watched it early

This WS - Bads of Bollywood(BoB) is much hyped for directorial debut of Aryan Khan. If he has really done all, then it is good but not excellent.

The story is routine except for a twist in the end that lovers are brother and sister from an illegal relationship. That was the most shit part of this WS. Probably it is first time that story ends in this way in Indian filmdom.

The WS is abundant with abuses. No holds barred- they abuse before parents, siblings, and all. Loud rap music. Useless fights. 

The lead Lakshya bursts into fight, here and there, which is very filmy, even on sets. Likewise  Boby Deol is acting as a superhero and always shown with a wine glass and cigarette in hands. Nothing new to show a villainous character. Many cameos but none memorable. It is a below average WS. 

What is the message out of this WS??- whether it is a love story or revenge drama or patriotic or sports or what??

The expletives/ abuses are plenty these days in movies/ WS released on OTT. But in this WS (BoB) they crossed all limits - all of them are hurling very filthy abuses in front of all.  May be the SRK and his family is accustomed to all this but I think still 99% of our population abstain from doing this, at least before someone whom you respect and especially ladies.

The simple funda is that when you like a movie/WS you may watch it again and again. But for this WS(BoB) you will repent that why you watched it?

The star ratings given till date seems to be paid and PR work like awards. 

Of casts i only liked Mona Singh and Manish Chaudhri.

Minus(-1)/5 stars. 

There should be (-) negative stars facility.",0
"Aryan Khan‚Äôs direction is truly impressive. Every scene feels thoughtfully crafted and seamlessly put together, showcasing not just style but strong storytelling sensibility. His work carries a freshness and confidence that makes the film engaging from start to finish. Aryan clearly knows his craft, displaying both talent and intelligence behind the camera. If this is his beginning, he promises to be a remarkable force in filmmaking and a bright contributor to the future of the Indian cinema industry.",1
"The web series is definitely a one time watch. For a first time direction Aryan Khan does a fabulous job. Star cast is aptly selected and each actor has does justice to the role they play. Lakshya and Raghav have good screen presence. ( I am a fan of Lakshya from Porus days...).Bobby Deol has played his character well. Big names in Bollywood have graced the film. The twist in the end was a surprise. Overall storyline could have been crisper, with a different unpredictable ending. Perhaps reserved for a Sequel!  A feedback is to have the language  toned down for covering younger audience. If Aryan continues this streek, we have a New Age of Entertainment opening up and we are ready!! Congratulations to the entire team of Bads of Bollywood. Take a bow for your hardwork.!",1
"""I enjoyed the series 'Bastads of Bollywood' for its humor and entertainment value. 

Raghav's quirky character and timing, especially in the scene where he sang 'Kaho Na Kaho' with Emraan Hashmi, stood out. 

The cast, including Rajat Bedi and Ranveer Singh's cameo, added to the show's appeal. Manoj Pahwa's comedic performance as a struggling background singer was particularly memorable. 

Overall, the series offers a fun, behind-the-scenes look at the film industry. I'd love to see a second season with new concepts and ideas.""",1
"First of all Aryan khan didn't let us down on his debut as a director and creator. If I want to put this series in simple words, it's a typical bollywood with a modern masala. 
Now coming to the actor They done a GREAT job , all the supporting characters were amazing the comic timing was bang on . A special shoutout to Raghav. The rumour is witty with some bollywood style dialogue that didn't felt cringe . The chemos of I should say of whole bollywood doesn't disappoint. Another shoutout to The Karan Johar loved his bollywood mafia style.
All in all it's a good watch . Good entertainment, with laughter and emotions and drama.

Toddles",1
"The Aryan Khan directed 'bastards of Bollywood or baddads of Bollywood'is a very creepy work being done on the hefty shoulders of full pledged nepotism and social contacts within the Bollywood. Yes, there are instances where goosebumps do take the place, the story do make one count upon it and the
actors like Raghav and Bobby
Deol have definitely made their
charm upon us. The very concept of
parody for the various Bollywood
concepts, the hidden realities
and the very sarcastic tone do stand tight on scale. Special mentions to Raghav and Bobby Deol ji. These have left the impacts, for sure.

Yet on an overall set, the whole show is a blatant failure for Aryan Khan as a
directorial debut as well as for all such
big big stars from SS Rajamouli
to 3 Khans.And the very the lumpous Laksh's acting was definitely not at all
appeasing. The whole
Bollywoodisation (2000s bollywood style of romanticissation of the story
is very disheartening to see. The story which was looking promising in the very beginning just ended up in same old school of same eloping the girl and getting into a marriage and fighting
with the girl's father, etc. 

The abuses in conversations, except for Raghav-Lakshay ones, were total inorganic and unnecessary especially those Manoj Baba ones.

The story got lost in between which suddenly got inspired from 90s movies.

No need to watch. Its a crap.",0
"""The Ba***ds of Bollywood"" is a wildly entertaining and a brave debut from director Aryan Khan. The show is a brilliant, self-aware satire that hilariously roasts the inner workings of the film industry with sharp wit and inside jokes. It's unapologetic, chaotic, and full of energy, making it a truly binge-worthy watch.
While the series is brimming with star-studded cameos that will delight fans, its real strength lies in the solid performances from the main cast and a story that has both heart and humour. It's a show that knows exactly what it is, and it delivers a fun, fast-paced, and clever ride that fans of Bollywood will absolutely love.",1
"Way too much of abusive demeaning and insulting words about mothers and sisters! Even family people are cursing all the time in front of younger generation. No decency at all! I have never heard so much of curse words in my whole life what was spoken in a few episodes of this show. Why did the producers and seniors actors let that happen? Do they really talk like that in their homes?? Are they scared, desperate or too apologetic to their own children for whatever reasons? Disgusting, obscene, disappointing with so many flaws ... hero doesn't have a cell phone for weeks, mother informs the son when father is going into operation theatre for his liver transplant, hero's best friend keeps getting them all into trouble, ruining his friend's career and justifying it saying ,"" he does these stupidity because he thinks from his heart. On top of that hero is so dumb, he thinks response to every set back is violence, a flash back of his dad's dialogue makes him do violent crimes. Wow! Way too away from the reality. This is what happens when  hurt and angry kids with no real life experiences from protected families get into their debut adventure of DIRECTING. Bad dialogues, unbelievable situations, delusional characters and of course very bad language blahh. Is everybody in the bollywood really that manipulative, crude, mean, sad and with no moral values? You did a good job in turning a beautiful fantasy and dreamland into stinking gutter for all the prople who loved and were inspired by bollywood.",0
"What an amazing series. I never felt dull for a single second. I can't remember how the time goes! This proves how good was this series. I found very few series or movies where every character gets such equal chance, contribution and impact. Hats off to Aryan Khan who has given every characters proper space and build up. When I was watching the series, trust me, I didn‚Äôt think that was his very first work. It looks like a very professional and well directed series. He must get a huge shout out for it.
Outstandingüî•üî•",1
"Just binged The Bads of Bollywood and wow, what a debut!

Aryan Khan doesn‚Äôt play safe here. The show is bold, messy, and unapologetically fun. What I loved most is how it flips the mirror on Bollywood itself  nepotism, power games, stardom it‚Äôs all served with satire, not sermons.

The cameos are hilarious, the production is slick, and the writing has that ‚Äúwink at the audience‚Äù energy. Sure, it stumbles at times with too much happening at once, but that‚Äôs also part of its chaotic charm.

For me, it‚Äôs less about perfection and more about a fresh voice daring to poke fun at an industry that usually takes itself too seriously. And on that front, it totally delivers.",1
"Absolutely horrible and garbage. What a lost opportunity. He had the privilege of calling the entire Bollywood and they make this filth. First things first, there was NO STORY, the script is so loose and so bad that it‚Äôs almost as repelling and repulsive as diarrhea.  The acting was so unconvincing and fake and artifical that I don‚Äôt know whether to blame the decent actors who played a role or the nepo director who couldn‚Äôt extract ANYTHING out of these actors. A lot of the scenes were straight out of cringetown and shameville with a ‚Äúsuspense‚Äù so pathetic anyone who could see the directionless path this show was heading towards would be able to tell the cliched and SAD so called ‚Äúsuspense‚Äù 

I am just alarmed at how much we as a nation have started celebrating mediocrity. Whether it is the Blind fan following of actors who just CANT act, to looking upto ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù who do NOTHING (Orry livers) to musicians who HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT MUSIC to so called ‚ÄúVIPS or builders‚Äù who are actually destroyers and have got free money falling into their lap for doing NOTHING. While doing so we are ignoring hardworking, talented, intelligent people with substance in this country just because they do not have a famous surname attached to their name.  Shameful if this is the direction this country is headed in then I‚Äôm ashamed to say it but this country has a dark future. STOP celebrating and elevating mediocrity and appreciate hardworking, talented, intelligent people with potential before it‚Äôs too late to save this country from shame and mockery.",0

"Honest Review

I started watching this series and stopped after just 10 minutes‚Äîthe scenes felt completely off and full of overacting.

Out of curiosity, I checked YouTube reviews and was surprised to see mostly positive feedback, especially about Imran Hashmi‚Äôs performance, so I gave it another shot‚Äîthis time at 3√ó speed‚Äîjust to see what was supposedly so special.
	1.	Star power wasted ‚Äì Big names like Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, and Imran Hashmi are brought in, but none of them have any meaningful impact. Imran‚Äôs scenes are mildly funny at best but still unrealistic.

	4.	Weak dialogue ‚Äì The lines are flat and often cringe-worthy.
	5.	Unoriginal ending ‚Äì The final sequence is clearly lifted from Our Fault (the car scene and the siblings reveal), offering nothing fresh.

"My review, my opinion - as being someone who has my own review after watching a show and dont come to watch a show after reading reviews. I love surprises. Aryan Khan did a great job as a debut director and he will for sure excel. With his first one he for sure had a lot of support from all the celebrity special appearances which kept us glued. I like imaigining what the show could have been without them. First scene just after premier when Aasman is out of his screening, is this how even a first timer gets into the streets? Haha I felt as if the actor is watching a dream and he will open his eyes to see his dreams shattered. It was off. Bobby Deol and his scenes had lot of grip. Even Aasman had lot of grip. Direction was not great. Lot of spices in many diff ways added in the show so lacked the depth, but great that Aryan might have got a glimpse that which spice suits his genre the best and he will be able to direct it. Overall I enjoyed it but want more depth from Aryan without special appearances.",1

BADS of Bollywood on Netflix is an engaging and power-packed series that lives up to the hype.

"Not the usual feel good show.Sort of darkish.Not everyone's cup of tea definitely.
Shades of Shahrukh Khan's life could be detected.
Loved everyone's acting especially Mona Singh, favourite since Jassi....,Bobby Deol stole the show and everyone was wonderful.Saw Emraan H after ages and can't imagine why he is not seen much these days.
Wish they had gone easy on the foul language.
It's a Great first attempt.
I don't know if I'll see it again but I enjoyed watching it once.
Good Aryan didn't go for acting as he would have been compared to his father very unfairly of course and Shahrukh Khan is a giant when it comes to acting.",1
"This show is absolute trash, brain-rot of the highest order. At best, Raghav manages to give you a chuckle here and there, but beyond that the so-called ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù is nothing more than cheap, foul-mouthed nonsense. And the worst part? It‚Äôs all being glorified in the name of ‚Äúcoolness.‚Äù

SRK‚Äôs PR team never misses a chance to paint Aryan Khan as some ultra-sanskaari saint. Well, if you want to truly understand his values, just watch this show. It perfectly reflects the mentality behind it, normalized disrespect towards parents, degrading jokes about one‚Äôs own sister, and a shallow portrayal of privilege disguised as entertainment. If this is what Bollywood calls ‚Äúedgy,‚Äù then God help us.

And let‚Äôs be honest, the only way this show is going to survive is through a tsunami of paid PR. Very soon your Instagram feed will be flooded with posts screaming about ‚Äúthe best debut of Aryan Khan.‚Äù Take my advice: it‚Äôs fucking not. Don‚Äôt fall for the propaganda.

The double standards you'll watch in this show, it‚Äôs like the show wants to roast Bollywood but ends up glamorizing the same toxic traits it pretends to critique. Basically, satire without teeth.

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the songs and background score, they‚Äôre like rubbing salt on an already festering wound.

To be blunt, Mr. Khan needs to accept the fact that none of his ‚Äúnepo products‚Äù are cut out for the entertainment industry. And honestly, the show should be rebranded from Bads of Bollywood to Tatti of Bollywood, because that‚Äôs exactly what it is, pure, unfiltered TATTI.",1

People keep on expecting hard hitting shows  at all times. It's a breezy as well as a witty watch. Aryan has a good future.

The ensemble is fun to watch. Finally some mainstream entertainment from bollywood.",1
Am really enjoying the series. Have watched three episodes till now and can just say that its done so well. The Emraan Hashmi part was so hilarious. Aryan Khan has done such a good job. He has brought some simple good actors as leads and shown their potential and some famous good actors as supports. This man has really prepared his work quite well. Keep it up! Aryan Khan and team. I see you as a shining star already. God Bless.,1
"Hear me out !!

This series had me on a rollercoaster. At first I was hooked. The first few episodes I really enjoyed. Then suddenly I was sitting there thinking wait what is going on Did I accidentally skip an episode or two Confusion turned into boredom but then episode seven arrived and the twist hit. Suddenly everything made sense. The title the buildup the chaos it all clicked. That one episode single handedly dragged the whole series out of mediocrity and into brilliance. The twist was not just good it was pure chef‚Äôs kiss good.

Also full credit to Aryan Khan. The man might as well have a PhD in Marketing Wizardry. He knew exactly what he was doing. The way he promoted the show was so creative and unique. Even the title itself was like a puzzle hiding clues until the story revealed the big twist. That is genuine marketing genius.

Overall the series had its ups and downs but thanks to the twist and the clever marketing I walked away genuinely impressed.",1
"Bads of Bollywood, good entertaining series by Aryan Khan on Netflix, though am not a TV person, I only watched it because of Shahrukh Khan's son.

Bobby Deol performance is superb, Emraan Hashmi lovable, Karan Johar my favorite always delightful, Manish Chaudhary very captive and others were wonderful.

"So many fake reviews OMG! Of course expected. Two of them are exact copy paste with different names. I am sure there are more. All the 3 to 5 para ones ending with a paragraph about overall review, gives it away. 

I had high hopes from the young director who had the best resources available to get trained as well as execute a project like this. The characters that clearly connect to real life people makes it interesting but even with that, the overly animated graphics, lame comedy (could have been executed way better), and missing grip in the story, made me loose interest from the first episode. I tried to keep watching giving it a fair chance, but I kept loosing interest. I am still giving 1 extra star for a great effort and a good topic to make a series on! üëè",1
"Best Bollywood shows I've watched in a long time now. Aryan very impressive as a director. Choosing one of the most difficult art in film making, Aryan impressed in every frame. He had a luxury to use his father's connection in the industry and all cameo used were spot on and blended perfectly with the movie.

I hope he didn't steal a direction credit of some one else.

Cause it was hard to accept the direction level for a debutant ..",1
"Ba**ds of Bollywood is an absolute treat for cinema lovers! Every actor delivers a powerhouse performance, perfectly complementing Aryan‚Äôs bold vision. The twisted plot keeps you hooked right till the end, while the dialogues and screenplay elevate the storytelling to another level. And of course, SRK shines in his best clean-shaven look yet‚Äîcharming, intense, and unforgettable.",1
"It was totally worth it to watch. I binge watched it and I loved it. Ofcourse, there were exaggerated scenes but those were cherry on the cake for me. Laughed a lot while watching this. Entire cast was good but I would like to specially mention Raghav Juyal. He was so good in his character that he made me forget that he is Raghav Juyal and made me fall in love with Parvaiz! What a character. I laughed in every scene he was involved in. Good work guys and keep making such series.",1
"What a great series! Normally, I tend to fast-forward to the conclusion, but this one kept me hooked without a single blink. I loved every second of it. The effort put in is evident‚Äîit beautifully blends family drama, comedy, nepotism, struggle, and action. Aaryan Khan has done a fantastic job, and I‚Äôve truly become a fan. The cast is outstanding, and every part of the series has been crafted with perfection.",1
"Such a cliche show. Nothing new and same old predictable story. Each Bollywood real character had a glorified entry irrespective whether the script required it or not. I had to FF half of the episodes. Just a weak characterisation. Acting was average. Dialogues needed to be more naturally flowing into the storyline. More hype than substance

And the sets and costumes looked so artificial. Everything looked too much polished. No authenticity at all. A great show should have great authentic feeling. Not sure if Aryan Khan watches good Hindi shows to learn from‚Ä¶. See panchayat, pataallok etc.

He has translated his Bollywood world around him from one side view only. You need to have experience in life to infuse soul into your creation. Sadly the soul was missing completely from the show.

Aryan should go on a road trip for a year to experience real life. People around him will  praise his work a lot but that is because of being the biggest nepo kid around and not because of his work.

This is evident when you are ridiculing Wankhade in the opening scene. This is abuse of your privilege and you will never blossom in your own. You are not cool when you are using the F* word all around‚Ä¶ thst does not make the show superb. It does not resonate with the audience. Sadly his idea of resonance was with his clique of people and not the audience.",1
"While the series makes an attempt to portray the darker, lesser-known side of the Hindi film industry, it ultimately falls short due to its lack of depth in storytelling and an over-reliance on shock value. The narrative feels shallow, often brushing over complex histories, personalities, and cultural nuances that could have added meaningful layers. Instead of presenting thoughtful explorations, the series seems content with surface-level dramatization.

Another major drawback is the excessive use of indecent, vulgar, and unspeakable language. While one could argue that such language mirrors the raw realities of the industry‚Äôs underbelly, its overuse feels unnecessary and, at times, forced. Rather than enhancing authenticity, it distracts from the story and risks alienating viewers who are looking for substance rather than sensationalism.

Overall, Bad**s of Bollywood misses an opportunity. With such rich and controversial subject matter at its disposal, it could have offered a bold, insightful, and thought-provoking narrative. Instead, it leans too heavily on profanity and shock, leaving viewers with a series that feels more exploitative than illuminating.",0
"The show is worth watching. What a move by srk. Exposing Bollywood and nepotism in aryans debut. All the actors have done a good job. Bobby deol, sehar, mqnoj Pahwa, Lakshya. But raghav steals she show with his wit and humour. Glad to see a promising debut of a star kid. Show isn‚Äôt perfect but is a good watch. Has its heart in the right place. The best episodes are 6&7. Looking forward to the second season. Aryan reminds me of SRK(not looks) but the presence and confidence.",1
"Must watched series . Actors are mind-blowing and dialogues are superb. Action , romance all are fantastic guys . I recommend to all go for the series actually its worth it.and last but not the least Aryan khan u proved that u r a good director enough. From now u r one of my fav Director. All the best for your future upcoming series or movies üëèüëç.",1
"Just finished watching on Netflix. 
I absolutely loved it!!!!!!!!
It was so refreshing to see something like this from Bollywood. 
Everything was amazing, on point, and so well done. If you love Bollywood then this is for you. Cameos were 10 on 10!!!!!

"Aryan Khan‚Äôs The Bads of Bollywood isn‚Äôt a film‚Äîit‚Äôs a punishment. From the first frame to the last, it feels like you‚Äôre watching someone test how much nonsense an audience can endure before walking out. Spoiler: it‚Äôs a lot, but not enough to survive this.

The direction is chaotic, like Khan threw ideas at the wall and filmed whatever slid down. Scenes stretch with no urgency, no flow, just dead air. The dialogue has all the warmth and energy of a voicemail, and the ‚Äúplot‚Äù is less a story than a pile of clich√©s duct-taped together.

Visually, it‚Äôs even worse. Shots cut together with no rhythm, silences drag like awkward family dinners, and the camera seems lost‚Äîlike even it wants to escape. The characters? Empty shells. Their ‚Äúemotions‚Äù are so forced you can predict the reaction before the line is spoken, yet the film still manages to surprise you by continuously lowering the bar.

Then comes the language. Every other line is littered with abuses, not to serve the narrative, but to shout, look how bold we are! It‚Äôs not bold‚Äîit‚Äôs lazy. It‚Äôs the cinematic version of a teenager scribbling swear words on a desk and calling it rebellion.

Cameos from fake Bollywood stars? Unnecessary, distracting, and unintentionally hilarious. The only flickers of actual performance come from Mona Singh and the elder Yajobi, but even they can‚Äôt rescue this shipwreck‚Äîthey‚Äôre background furniture in a room that‚Äôs already on fire.

By the end, you‚Äôre not just done with the film‚Äîyou‚Äôre done with the idea of giving Aryan Khan another chance. The Bads of Bollywood isn‚Äôt just bad art; it‚Äôs anti-art. It mocks your time, your patience, and your intelligence. If this is what ‚Äúfresh vision‚Äù looks like, give me every over-the-top 90s melodrama on repeat‚Äîthey‚Äôd win awards next to this disaster.",0
"Just completed watching Badsofbollywood. An outright rollercoasterüî•üòÇ

A refreshing ride through the adventures of humour and GenZ stuffs. It was hilarious throughout and a satirical take on the inner workings of cinema industry.
 The story around Bollywood industry .

"Just finished The Bads of Bollywood and holy shit, I loved every second of it. It‚Äôs messy, loud, dramatic, and so damn addictive exactly what Bollywood is. The digs at nepotism and fake PR games had me howling, the cameos were a treat, and the cast brought crazy energy (Raghav especially had me rolling).

And Aryan Khan? Man, for a first project he went all in. No playing safe, just full throttle chaos and honesty. Respect.",0
"I spent 7 hours on this series and honestly have mixed feelings. The first 6 episodes were brilliant‚Äîpacked with cameos, witty Bollywood references, and sharp direction by SRK‚Äôs son.
 He even brought SRK, Aamir, and Salman together, with SRK‚Äôs cameo easily stealing the show. But the final episode completely ruined it for me. After building intense romantic chemistry between the leads, the shocking reveal that they‚Äôre actually siblings was bizarre and felt like a cheap, pro-Bollywood twist. What started as a 4.5/5 entertaining ride turned into a 1/5 disappointment. If I‚Äôd known the ending, I would‚Äôve stopped at episode 6. Watch wisely.",1
"Im not even sure where to begin, this is ok if it‚Äôs made for 12 - 14 years old, however, even they may turn their nose up to the huge nepotistic series. (The irony!)

I‚Äôm now only watching to see who SRK has managed to get to do a guest spot, otherwise, not really worth the time. 

So much hype over the last few weeks and so little return - Big let down.

Maybe after a few more projects the director will get his rhythm. 

On a plus, Bobby Deol was very good.

Also if you‚Äôre going to add reviews to this site via BOTs at least have the sense to change the words.

A lot of the supposed 5* reviews have different names but the exact same wording üòÇüòÇüòÇ",1

I am extremely exited for its 2nd part and I hope it will be more joy and fun.",1
"It is an absolute treat! It's bold, unapologetic and refreshingly orignal. The storyline is sharp, the performance are magnetic and a whole vibe feels like a fresh wave in bollywood. It doesn't just entertain it makes you think, laugh and feel at all once. Q must watch for someone who craves something different yet deeply engaging.",1
"In OTT due to social media publicity it will be watched but if it was a theatre release it would be worst flop. 
The debut direction of napo kid Aryankhan Shahrukh khan is average. 
Statutory warning : it‚Äôs not family viewing for foul language. F**k word is used five fifty times and equally by male and female artists with free flow. Sex  act gestures is nauseating Suspense in climax reveals love story between siblings from two mothers and one father justifies the title THE BASTARDS OF BOLLYWOOD.

"You can say you dont need to watch it , but what else there is to enjoy better than this. If you just want to enjoy for some 6-7 hours , definitely watch this. You get hooked from the first minute and wont realise when did you reach 4th episode. This is how entertainment should be. They tell you literally this is brainrot, but the best one. If you love Bollywood, gossips, insider news, watch this. Note - E6 end ( epic writing- Euphoria vibes)",1
"Binge watch !
Mast ahe. Finished whole series one night 

*If it's really made by* Aryan Khan then he deserves real applause.

Lakshya, Raghav Juyal, THE Manoj Pawha, Mona Singh and infact everyone extremely well fitted in the rolls. 
Bobby Deol and Karan Johar nails it by their performances. One is underacting and other is overacting..as demanded by the script.. Superb.

Aryan Khan is bold enough to showcase nepotism , star kids,  and drug and his own arrest  by Sameer wankhede similar scene in slapstick manner.

Pleasent experience to watch !",1
What a show!!! Amazing cast. Everyone played their parts so well especially casting Raghav as one of the main leads was the perfect decision Aryan khan has made. No one can do Emraan Hashmi‚Äôs scene better than him. What a great actor. Aryan has killed it with his his debut. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND RELEASE MORE SEASONS!!!,1
Wow - Aryan . Amazing Talent . Future is going to see you a lot of you . This is the best satire I had ever seen in my 60 odd years of age . From a debutant directorOMG . The generational drift not withstanding I enjoyed with squirming on my seat at times . The subtleties and at times brazenness in narration is remarkable. Be bold and brave like your debut. Hats off to Shahrukh and Gauri for having given him a free hand .,1
"What a great debut by Aryan Khan! After a long time, I finally watched something truly refreshing and entertaining. The film is filled with exciting cameos, which made it even more fun to watch. Personally, I absolutely loved Emraan Hashmi Camio such a standout! And Gafoor‚Äôs music? Too hilarious, I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. LMAO!",1

"Loved it sooooo much! 
The parallels, the completing the circle, the Easter eggs, the plot twists, the references, the irony. Everything! 

The best part of it all? Aryan khan. Unlike other nepo babies who actually like they have to work hard *just* like the outsiders to build their careers, he proved how using your privileges right can make all the difference. He had the access to the resources and he freakin used it right! Loved everything about it. 

And then there's the title. Boy oh boy. You absolute genius. Hiding the ""star"" in the name so clearly, my gosh! 

Looking forward to more brilliant pieces by Aryan and team!",1
"What a pleasant surprise! It's Bollywood's version of Entourage, with a strong dose of action sprinkled toward the third act. Aryan is competent with keeping the drama moving and presenting spectacle, but the comedy in the show is the real star. The laughs have a nostalgic nineties feel in the best possible way. Yes, it is partly a cameo fest, but each celeb adds weight and a fun wrinkle to the series. Definitely worth your time! 

""AKHA BOLLYWOOD EK TARAF..."" üòâ",1
"Good fun... Awesome mixture of comedy, drama, thrill and little bit of romance. Binged Watched it. Every character has been carefully crafted and been taken mostly from Shahrukh Khan's previous films. Manoj Pahwa & Raghav are to me the stand out performers. Bobby Deol is what he does best - intense, ruthless. Also liked Bobby Deol's bodyguard Sukkhi :) What a gentle giant.",1
"The show starts off with a bang and keeps the audience hooked throughout. The meta humor and slight digs at the people around the industry are also done in a refreshing way. Cameos don't feel forced and you want to root for the MC. Well written, well shot and well performed by everyone involved.

Superb debut for Aryan. Lakshya and Raghav are a hit duo.",1
"It's starts off with a lot of promise. However, ends up as ""meh!""
The VFX and thrills are worth their mettle. The special appearances add that excitement, by the end of it this looks a little overdone and forced. It starts pretty much on the face of it that big wigs are constantly making appearances, just out of their camaraderie and respect for Shah Rukh and Gauri.
The script totally falls flat and there are too many missess. It's as though the makers kept suffering partial memory loss throughout. For example: there is a whole episode dedicated to Jaraj and Avtar sticking a friendship, and there is a follow up to it when Avtar calls Jaraj to join them as a friend. Where Jaraj even says he has news to share about Aasmaan. But suddenly happens to see Aasmaan's kidnapping by Gafoor's men and his intentions and loyalties change track, without much of an explanation.
Then again: the whole Gafoor track seems to have gaps, it's brought in and out of the story in a very uncohessive and arbitrary way. It's as though the makers keep remembering and then keep forgetting him.
Sameer seems to disappear almost suddenly as if he was never part of the story.
All in all even if it's seen as a masala entertainer, it doesn't do justice to that genre, as every track feels incomplete and erratic.
It's odd that Shah Rukh who would have the best script writers and editors at his disposal would end up doing such shoddy work.
The VFX is a good wrapping paper around this very unthoughtful gift for the audience.
Whoever is giving this one 5 stars or is saying great things about this show, is clearly a paid reviewer.
I mean a brilliant film like Rocky Aur Rani ki Prem Kahani has 6.5 on IMDb. But this show gets 7.8, it's absolutely unthinkable and has to be rigged!",1
"New era of Bollywood began...
Series is awesome all types of combinations are in this. You can't feel bore while watching this.

"If you‚Äôve ever wanted to waste 8‚Äì10 hours of your life, just pick the bads of Bollywood series. Same gangster stories, same family drama, same ‚Äúlove triangle‚Äù nonsense. Honestly, Bollywood should start giving loyalty cards for how often they copy-paste their own scripts. Every character either screams like they‚Äôre in a wrestling match or cries like someone stole their Wi-Fi. Subtlety? Never heard of it. One episode‚Äôs worth of story is shamelessly dragged it. Cheesy one-liners, cringe ‚Äúgyaan‚Äù, and dialogues that sound like they were written at 2 AM on caffeine overdose. Designer clothes, glossy sets, and actors too busy showing off. Story? Oh, that‚Äôs optional in Bollywood. Want abuses? Throw them in. Want random bold scenes? Add them, even if the plot doesn‚Äôt need it. Want logic? Sorry, that‚Äôs out of stock. After hours of your patience, you‚Äôll either get a lazy open ending or a finale so bad, you‚Äôll wish you never started. ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶",0
"Aryan Khan‚Äôs directorial debut The Bada of Bollywood is a vibrant, ambitious and emotionally rich film that signals the arrival of a powerful new voice in Indian cinema.

"Aryan Khan makes a smashing debut as director with The Bads of Bollywood‚Äîa witty, stylish, and razor-sharp satire on the glamour and chaos of the film industry.

The movie does well in terms of entertainment, but the climax was a bit disappointing. It could have been written and executed much better. A stronger ending would have made the film far more impactful.

"It‚Äôs honestly funny to watch someone from such an affluent background like SRK‚Äôs son desperately trying to clear his image by mocking India‚Äôs narcotics bureau. Okay, we get it, you have the resources to pull it off. But here‚Äôs the trick: Bollywood has mastered the psychology of nepotism. They know people hate it, so what do they do? Make a film that openly ‚Äúexposes‚Äù nepotism, fill it with talented outsiders to look authentic, and in the process flip the narrative to make themselves look cool and relatable. And of course, it also doubles as an image-cleanup for someone who was literally arrested, but can still pull this off only because of the very nepotism they‚Äôre pretending to laugh at. The irony is the joke",1

"So much and so many resources available but ‚Ä¶. Probably this is what nepotism is about . He created so much above his maturation level ‚Ä¶. Although boring but still technically it‚Äôs balanced. How much it‚Äôs of him ‚Ä¶ we have to wait and watch . If I forget who created this ‚Ä¶this is boring 
This looks more of Karan‚Äôs personal project n he took it as his responsibility. This is how entire project is looking about. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs real or Karan made it look look like it. Pls allow this chap to work independently without any influence.. will wait for his real work",0
"So exceeded my expectations. I didn‚Äôt expect something this good from Aryan and his team. As a newcomer, he really nailed how to make people laugh (which is funny, since he rarely shows it on his own face). The dialogues were another highlight; sharp, witty, and hilarious.",1
"Never thought this would be good, but I loved it. Love the plot twist. He has selected the best and most fitting cast, although some celebrities felt unnecessary. On second thought, seeing all the big stars in one movie was actually nice. Overall, Aryan has done a good job.",1
"It's good honestly. 
The characters are well-written, the story is good and most importantly the satire fits the show very well. Cast was good, Aasman's character felt a bit boring or too bold to survive. The music wasn't that good. The action scenes were well-done. The plot loses pacing or relevance sometimes. But I think there is the catch. it tries to mix satire with thriller which is difficult to do. So, naturally the plot diverts now and then.I really loved the dry humour and the cameos were random but fun to see. They didn't look too forced or imposing. I feel it is commendable for a debut series. And it is worth watching for one time fun. But again, he has a long way to go. If it was not his first show, I'd give it 3.5/5. But honestly, it deserves a solid 4/5 as a pilot work.",1
"Whoa what a show... I am not a person who watches series, I thought let's check this out n after 1 episode I decided to stay on n it was like a surprise.. very well done Aaryan Khan.. excellent work man.. congratulations.. please release next season soon.. perfectly blended show to keep the audience entertained in every aspect...

"It‚Äôs so surface level as if someone watched actors‚Äôs promotional video, interviews , koffee with Karan , few reels and decided to write a story. There is no depth whatsoever , I simply refuse to believe that someone who has grown up in the industry has made this.

I am truly saddened for the future of Bollywood. RIP",1
"Great direction, Aryan.
As a lifelong SRK fan, I thought you might always remain in his shadow. But with this, you‚Äôve shown the world‚Äîand people like me‚Äîthat you‚Äôre capable of creating your own light. Congratulations on stepping out and proving yourself so brilliantly. Keep shining!",1

"Binge watched The Ba***ds of Bollywood. Very engaging and slick. Everyone's acted very well. Aryan Khan has done a tremendous job. Doesn't feel like a first time director's work. The story is nothing out of the ordinary but the twist in the last episode made it very interesting. The problem is the excessive use of cuss words. And some vulgar & crude jokes and scenes, which add nothing to the story. It would be even more watchable, if they are edited out. Deleting a star for that !",0
"The show is very well made . From the first episode it keeps you hook with it's production quality , direction and storyline . All the actors have really done a fabulous job . But this series have some cringe moments which were really not needed . The climax and the twist was not at all expected . The climax may be or may not be  loved by everybody . Personally according to me it was not so good but the overall show was good to watch.",1
This show is very good and aryan khan has really made it fantastic with his absolute story and direction. The last twist was like really 89 percent copied from Final Destination Bloodlines if you watch it. There is very much abuse which I think there are two options for aryan khan firstly he like gaalis or probably bollywood stars say that much abuses and the 7th episode scene of Ajay Talvar son was absolutely shit!,1
"I'm not usually a huge fan of Indian shows, but this one was amazing üò≠ so funny and so many little references that make the show top notch. This is genuinely a really impressive show considering it's by a fairly inexperienced director and newcomer actors! Everything was so well done, you could tell that this show had a VERY large budget",1
"I absolutely loved this web series! The storyline is gripping, the performances are outstanding, and the visuals are top-notch. Every episode kept me hooked and wanting more, with the right balance of drama, suspense, and emotions. Truly binge-worthy and one of the best Netflix series I‚Äôve watched in a while. Highly recommended ‚Äì 5 stars!‚Äù",1
"I'm African so it takes a lot to get me hooked on a show but this one was just amazing. 8.5/10 for me. Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen, it shocked me everytime. The acting, visuals etc is exactly what I wanted.

Aryan Khan, you have a fucked up mind and I love it.",0
"Thoroughly enjoyed this web series..... Very well directed..... Fantastic acting by all the actors. Impressed by Character of AASMAN n PARVEZ..
Overall it was great to watch ARYAN KHANS direction..
Maybe some cuts were required here and there, the scene which said climax waa not required.

Overall all the Actors have done a great job.",1
"To be very honest I had very little expectations from the web series. Once I started watching it I couldn't stop, just finished the entire web series in 1 day it is that good. It sort of forced me towards the next episode. The ending is crazy, I mean really crazyy. I don't think there could have been a more surprising ending. The direction is also very good. Worth watching trust me on this.",1
"I cannot believe a 27 year old Aryan Khan wrote and directed this show. It was amazing, dramatic, witty, and just a great balance of everything in between. Cast did GREAT, main leads and the supporting cast were amazing. 10/10 recommend. Also I cannot wait to see more from Aryan!",1
"It‚Äôs truly a shame when a show with a promising premise is utterly ruined by a complete and total lack of class. I had hoped to enjoy the show, but after giving it a chance, I couldn't endure the constant, foul, and frankly, lazy language. What could have been an engaging story is instead a cringeworthy barrage of profanity.
The swearing in this series is not used to enhance character or plot; it feels completely gratuitous, like the writers simply didn't have the talent to create compelling dialogue without resorting to every swear word in the book. It's shocking how often the characters use the ""f"" word‚Äîto the point where it becomes unbearable and just plain tedious. It's a shame to see an otherwise good story flooded with such unnecessary vulgarity.
I was extremely disappointed and couldn't sit through more than a few minutes without being completely put off. There was zero enjoyment to be had. What a waste of potential. Feel sorry for SRK",0
"I rarely write reviews for any movies or webseries! But Man this one was amazing.... 
Every actor/sideartist did a fabulous job!! Lakshay and Raghav absolutely loving performance. A total fun bollywood masala banger! Fun addictive content after a long while. Waiting for Season 2.",1
I only watched first episode and I came here to leave my review.  Im shocked by negative reviews mostly fake negative reviews.. we all know who is giving negative its all political propaganda against srk and his family . Just watch the show its damn good and yes master piece.  Do check my reviews history as its genuine review and do click on others negative reviews will see they all fake just try to ruin the reputation of Khans .. but fortunately series is too good so negative reviews won't really bother .. must watch 10 out of 10.. watch it and thanks me later,0
"Aryan directional effortsbhas paid off. Very interesting n entertaining. A lots of irony comical situations.pahwa character was hilarious n funny.everyone had their moments n cunningness. Aryans touched the drug scene .
Anyway congrats Aryan on your success. God bless you with more such enthusiasm n efforts.your father n family must be proud of your achievements",1
"What an absolute disaster. This show is the definition of style without substance ‚Äî except it doesn‚Äôt even have style. It‚Äôs nothing more than a painfully overhyped PR stunt shoved down the audience‚Äôs throat with flashy promotions and zero content.

The direction? Amateur at best. The screenplay? Written like a bad school play. And the dialogues ‚Äî just an endless parade of forced abuses thrown in for shock value. Newsflash: swearing doesn‚Äôt make your show edgy; it makes it lazy.

If there was a competition for most pointless waste of time, this show would be the undefeated champion. Watching it felt like being robbed of precious hours of my life ‚Äî hours I‚Äôll never get back.

Verdict: Don‚Äôt just skip it, run from it. Even hate-watching isn‚Äôt worth the torture.",0
Its just average first few episodes was great its all depends on the cameos of stars and The uncle character is a totally waste story was cheap the last episode is very subjective you either hate it or like it. You can see how much production value they put it on. if some one new comers or not aryan khan make this its was totally unrecognized unforgettable. so all these mostly reviews are fake and pr is very high because of srk team.,1
"The insane world of bollywood has a new psychiatrist and he is kicking ass . The very novelty that he is behind not front of the camera has already bought him all the browny points plus the halo so right fully earned.
You need to have very inventive and relevant topics and characters to help this subject fly. The insider that he is has managed to give a very engaging and caricature based view of the potboiler called Bollywood . Fast fantastic and fanatic",1
"It's hilarious, outstanding, fantastic, mind-blowing series that i have watched right now, unbelievable that a 27 years old boy made it so well. I am Mesmerized, and feeling so blessed that we're gonna have the best prince Director ahead, production of The king of bollywood. Really it's too much fun.",1

"When I had seen Lakshya as Puru, which was a brilliant serial and this boy had acted fantastic well... I knew he would be a big star... N yesss I loved this series . Proud of Aaryan after all the criticism u nailed it... U Nailed it... What a cast, u proved that u are real Simba son of the King...",1
"Wow amazing series. This is as good as SRK any best movies. Huge congratulations on a brilliant series. Aryan has exceeded the expectations and smashed it out of the park. 
SRK must be proud and little jealous as well .
This has everything , just keep the season 2 as good as this unlike others who make shit",1
"The story is good. Action is good aaasman did goood jod. Sanya loooking so hottt. Karishma is stunnning. Overall good direction by aryan Khan. Good to see second part of this asap. But I think end could be better. But no issue 

Raghav bhai love u man. My man üòÇ you are a very talented person. 

Regards
Aman",1
I am a king khan fan.. So I had to watch the series.. Honestly I didn't expect Aryan will did such a splendid job as director compared to his sister Sohana as actress.. This is so great and 7/10 in comedy.. 6/10 in romance 6/10 in twist. Impressed by Raghav very much .. overall veryyyy entertaining,1
"A great debut by Aryan the Director. The same old story but the way he has used Humour in this series is awesome. Good performances from the cast especially Raghav, Bobby deol and the character who played Bobby's son in the film were great. A fun filled entertainer. A Good watchüëçüèª",1
"Really good! Not boring at all ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt skip a single scene. The climax was great, comedy was spot on, acting was strong, and the action was impressive too. No overacting, no forced comedy. The direction was excellent. Unlike the kind of films Karan Johar makes with star kids, Aryan‚Äôs direction was a thousand times better.",1
What a show mann!!!! Totally refreshing and entertaining. Didnt expect the story to take such a wild and entertaining turn . All actors have done great job and the celebrities presence have added so much life to the show. Last but not the least Aryan Khan has done the best job. He has just lived beyond expectations.I totally enjoyed and loved the show ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"Honestly, it‚Äôs refreshing to see how someone can casually yet sarcastically explain things so clearly not just clearing his own name, but also the entire Bollywood‚Äôs. 

As a director, he shows us exactly how we see Bollywood but from their point of view such a brilliance.

My opinion about Aryan Khan has completely changed at this point, and I feel we should remember that what we see and hear isn‚Äôt always real without a proper enquiry.",1
"was hesitant to start, assuming it would be another overhyped Aryan Khan project, but the first few episodes actually gave me hope. They hinted at a more realistic and satirical side of Bollywood, and for a while it worked. But then came the unnecessary Bollywood-style action sequences that shattered the realistic bubble, and worst of all, the pointless incest angle. By the end, it fell back into tired clich√©s. A wasted opportunity that confirms Bollywood still can‚Äôt let go of its old formula.",0
"What a Show Man !!!

This Is Literally First Time I Am Posting Any Review Of Any Movie Or A Series Because This Aryan Khan's Directorial Web Series Has Forced Me To Do This...

Fabulous Righting 
Fabulous Acting
Fabulous Twist and Turns
Fabulous Climas

4.5 Stars Out Of 5 Stars

Brilliant Lakshya Raghav And All Actresses And One And Only Aryan Khan 

Hat's Off Man üéâ",1
"I usually refrain from watching shows with colourful language & violence, however made an exception for this one & it was JUST SUPERB !!!
Not only is it brilliantly made, but ultra entertaining with outstanding acting.
Aryan Khan, I wish you continued success for a lifetime ! Cheers!",1
"Unfortunately despite all the hype , this failed to impress. The plot was too draggy and the scenes seemed all over the place making it hard to follow. I also found the level of profanities used by the characters to be jarring. For a first time director, I must say it was a good effort from Aryan overall however it leaves room for improvement. I trust that with time and honing of skills, he will do even better in future.",0
"This show is amazing. Everyone should watch it. It's a great start to Aryan Khan's career. Older writers and directors should learn from it what audiences want.I don't want to dwell on this further, and I urge all of you to watch the show.",1
"Bads of Bollywood is a refreshing take on cinema, blending humor with sharp insights.
The storytelling feels raw, honest, and incredibly entertaining.
It sheds light on Bollywood‚Äôs lesser-known sides with wit and style.
A must-listen/watch for anyone who loves movies beyond the glitz",1
"This webseries is very funny to watch and full of entertainment. The topic itself is bold and interesting, and the show keeps you hooked with its humour, cameos, and satirical take on Bollywood. Aryan Khan‚Äôs debut is refreshing, stylish, and worth watching. Definitely a fun series to binge.",1
"As expected, Hindi series are going down side.Too much Overacting from so many actors. Just emaran hashmi and bobby deol done a good acting. Story is in bad category. Direction by aryan khan is also below avg but better than worst. 
Some dialogues are good but not story requirement. 
Sone funny points in starting of some episode. (Only reason that I watched till end)
Dont waste your time here.",0
"The first-time director Aryan Khan has absolutely nailed it! üé¨ Loved the series‚ÄîI binge-watched it in one go. Every actor has done a brilliant job, and not once did it feel boring.
Fabulous script, top-notch direction, and outstanding performances all around. Go for it.",1
Amazing movie. This is an honest review as I attended the movie premiere and I didn't expected anything from this movie but it surprised full of new elements and aryan khan has really explored the Nepo side of bollywood highly impressed we should always appreciate the correct young talent. SRK has raised his son right,1
"I honestly went in with zero expectations, thought it was going to be trash like Archies. But after finishing the whole series, I‚Äôd say it was definitely worth watching. It‚Äôs not on the same level as some of the top Indian Netflix shows, but still a solid watch overall.",1
Well balanced drama based on reality .Riaky subject chosen and delivered well .  Very engrossing and entertaining. It‚Äôs a very unique attempt of entertainment. The hard work of Aryan showed ; too good for a first entry into this industry. Highly talented .,1
"‚ÄúAryan Khan‚Äôs directorial debut is bold, witty, and full of heart. ‚ú® The Ba****ds of Bollywood doesn‚Äôt just entertain‚Äîit dares to poke fun at the industry while celebrating its madness. A stylish satire with strong performances and plenty of surprises. Definitely worth the binge! üëèüé¨‚Äù",1
"The cinematography was good, and of course, the colouring was done by Red Chillies Entertainment, so no doubt it was brilliant. The songs may not be all-time chartbuster type, but they were well used in the series. The screenplay was excellent üëå, and there‚Äôs an unexpected twist in the story that will leave you in shock and completely change the whole plot.",1
"Bads of Bollywood is pure madness in the best way possible! Bold, stylish, and sooo addictive you can‚Äôt stop watching once you start. The performances? Killer. The vibe? Unmatched. Finally, something that feels fresh, daring, and unapologetically entertaining. Bollywood really needed this punch of crazy energy and I‚Äôm here for it!",1

Interesting. Performance by Lakshya is TOO GOOD. Even his Screen Friend did VeryGood Job. Lakshya‚Äôs Screen Manager & his Screen Girl friend- both Females have done VeryVery Good. Though the End - Car Chase & Fighting Scenes Are Typically of Commercial Movies of mass. Worth Watching. As a First Directorial of Aryan Khan- üëç,1
"What a best series, i ever watched. Bestestttt and so amazinggg.
i am not a web series person, but still i watched and every episode wass full on fun, from drama to romance, Action to emotional, Entertainment to full on fun. Every thing was on a top notchh. Whole story was üî•.  Every character, like OMG !!!  Bestest drama i have ever seen üòçüòçüòç",1
"Its a decent show. Definitely better than many things you are watching on Netflix these days.. Atleast they have tried something different.. 

Definitely a few things could have been better but here people r either giving it 5 stars or 1... both of them have their personal reasons... 

If you trust me, this show is 3.5/5 but i am giving .5 stars for trying something different..",1
"What a stupid crappy show. 

Shocked to see the show and even more shocked to read the reviews... Seriously where has media integrity disappeared??? 

A perfect example of how a rich spoilt star kid can waste truckloads of his father's money just because he doesn't have to feel the pinch of it. 

Imagine any other first time director making a show like this. The media would have ripped him and the show and the actors to bits and the director would never have got another chance ever again. 

Total horrible crap. 

The 1 lone Star is for lakshya lalwani who gets out of this shit with just a bit of it on him.",0
"Story is more of how film industry or bollywood works. Instead of sugar coating, reality is shown in a satirical way. Aryan did very good job for a first project. Almost all the big bollywood stars are in this series. Every one acted well but Raghav is too good. It is much better than expected and a good entertainer.",1
"Go, watch this show! New, fresh something that you haven't seen for a long time. Awesome debut by Aryan Khan as a director. The performance of all actors are really good. Unexpected cameos. Everything makes this series a perfect entertainer.",1
"Being from Bangladesh üáßüá©, I have to admit I‚Äôve been frustrated with Bollywood for a while, having seen so many disappointing shows. I honestly thought they couldn‚Äôt bring anything good anymore. But Aryan Khan‚Äôs show proved me completely wrong! The plot twist is amazing omg! Overall, it‚Äôs truly fantastic.

10000000/10",1
"The Ba***ds of Bollywood is an out and out entertainer. It's pure madness. Hilarious, stylish, and unapologetically dramatic.
It‚Äôs a true masala-packed ride that keeps you hooked with its perfect blend of comedy, chaos, and charisma. A must-watch for anyone who loves Bollywood at its loudest and most entertaining best.",1
"The movie is excellent but language too fresh. I did not like it. I think this movie was made for todays street people no offense Arian khan did amazing job for first time directing. So proud of him.  My son started with rap music and he used this language. We thought it was not expectable for our community. It was 10 years ago. Now time changed.  
Best of luck.",1
"as a new comer woo my god Aryan you have done a superb job , on that particular DAD scene i cried like a baby , I also lost my father at the age of 4. I loved it bro. god bless . and everyone should watch it.",1
"Technology is getting good in every movie and series infact the visual effects were good here..
Overall color, light, angle and each thing turned out to be perfect.. 
But the main fact that matters is suspense and storyline. And this series did the best here and so It's a 5 star..",1
"I have to give it to Sharukh Khan son well done.  When Aryan Khan name comes up the first thing that comes to mind is the drug conspiracy which was plotted and planned to do him over.  He used that negative thing which was a big part and a big test for him and his family and put into the first episode.  Genius guy just like his dad, he didn't hide from it or cover it up he put the same drug issue into his first production.  Genius this boy will keep the Khan name going",1
"Enjoyed watching such an a entertaining web series. 
I never thought it will come out so well.
Congratulation Aryan Khan for your debut. 
All the best cast crew Badass of Bollywood 
I wish you all the best fitness project",1
"This was the best Bollywood webseries man! This what we want to see, amazing storyline amazing dialogue, so talented aryan is MAN! I just completed the series i really appreciate y'all!

"I've always loved Indian films and thought I'd seen it all, till I watched The Bads of Bollywood. All the familiar tropes are in place ‚Äî love-hate drama, power games, nepotism, the underdog narratives, drug scandals, underworld connections, all portrayed in a fresh and unique way that is beyond awesome!!! A great show indeed.",1
"Watched it coz the trailer was impressive plus it was Aryan Khan's directorial debut. It was an entertaining series but the direction was not consistent. It was a mash up between the filmmaking style of Farah khan and Madhur Bhandarkar. 
The bad language, the abuses after every line was not necessary. Its not meant for Family viewing. Aryan shud take care of that next time. 
The actors did a good job especially Raghav Juyal and Bobby Deol. 
Overall a one time watch.",1
"Gripping, irreverent, flashy, sharp, witty, funny, MASSY and bonus: amazing chemistry! This is what was missing from Bollywood for a while now!

Update:
Just finished the show
That was quite an anti climax, huh
But was a mad ride and picked up at the end :)
Waiting for Season 2!",1
"Aryan Khan‚Äôs debut as writer-director in The Ba*ds of Bollywood is a compelling entry into OTT ‚Äî his distinct voice, sharp humour, and layered character work make the series stand out. The cast delivers skillfully, elevating a story that is both entertaining and heartfelt, proving Aryan isn‚Äôt just the son of a superstar ‚Äî he‚Äôs a creator worth watching",1
"Ba***ad is literally such a vibe üî• The plot is wild, the drama is top tier, and the performances had me hooked fr. Loved every bit of it ‚Äì def a must-watch if you‚Äôre into something raw, crazy and super entertaining. 10/10 would binge again üëè‚ú®",1
"Bads of Bollywood is a hilarious deep dive into the glorious disasters of Hindi cinema. With sharp wit, playful roasting, and pure love for the madness, it turns cringe into comedy gold. Totally worth watching-equal parts nostalgia, fun, and sass. A must for every Bollywood fan!üòéüëåüèº",1
"This is Phenomenon..
I binge 15 hrs a day.. No Series kept unwatched..

"Good one.
Multiples cameos and funny.
Standout where Raghav, Lakshay, Rajat Bedi

Conclusion could have been better and was a bit odd but the take on drug raid was excellent..lol
Would give 9/10.
Aryan: excellent Direction.",1
"I was not expecting this, ohmygod Aryan it was just so fucking awesome. You didn't leave any clice.

"Movie - Bads of Bollywood 

Review - I just watched the first episode of this drama on Netflix.
This show is Unbearable and a Total disaster üòÇ 
I bet you can't even watch 1 full episode.
The intent of this show is to whitewash NEPOTISM and DRUG ABUSE in Bollywood.

They have a character in this movie who looks exactly like ACP Wankhede who arrested Aryan Khan. They havemade him a joke and tried to white wash drug abuse in Bollywood.
SRK used his muscle power to get every actor, director and singer in his son's movie and delivered this Shit ü§£ 
Such a bad movie üçø",0
"It was a great refresher series. Very witty and dark sense of humour. Showing friendships, loyalty and dark secrets in families.. and how its kept quiet because you are under the limelight. Great watch. Bollywood needed to provide something new ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"One of the worst web series I‚Äôve ever watched! Completely overhyped and stuffed with 90% of Bollywood‚Äôs faces in supporting roles that add absolutely nothing new. The content lacks depth, originality, and coherence, and it‚Äôs painfully clear that the fake 5-star reviews are doing the heavy lifting.

The script is weak, the storyline is dragged out, and the forced drama makes no sense. Within minutes, it resorts to unnecessary abusive language just to seem ‚Äúcool.‚Äù The flow is disjointed, the narrative unengaging, and it ends up being nothing more than a showcase of nepo kids doing nepo things.

A total waste of time ‚Äî don‚Äôt fall for the hype. To put it simply, it‚Äôs a messy Bollywood circus disguised as a web series.",0
"Ba***ds of Bollywood is a very honest and raw take on the dark side of Bollywood.It doesn't seem like Aryan Khan's directorial debut.Such a well scripted and entertaining series! A brilliant director in the making.SRK must be proud of his son.Interesting cameos and natural spontaneous performances by the cast.Way to go ,Aryan Khan !",1
"Superb superb series. Light hearted comedy. Mazaa aa gayaa. Baaki sab jab iss samay bass crime crime crime pe series bann rahi hai. Such a nice break. Not a single dull moment. Really enjoyed.

"Absolute entertainment, peak entertainment, reminded me of the Farah Khan masala movies which were so empty but soooo fun to watch. Now this series takes itself seriously but never looses its bollywood swag. Good plot yet super fun, this is a must watch.",1

"*The Ba***ds of Bollywood* is a riotous satire that skewers the industry's nepotism and drama with sharp wit, stellar performances (Lakshya and Raghav Juyal shine!), and meta cameos. Aryan Khan's debut is chaotic, indulgent, and wildly fun‚Äîperfect for Bollywood fans who love a good roast. 4. 5/5 stars!",1
"we already know  the movie cast  talent in other projects, here we seen acting them as more free spirited, and everyone just killed it.

"Overall, D Ba***ds of Bollywood seems to be a amazing but mostly fun effort. If u‚Äôre some1 who loves Bollywood itself‚Äîits drama, glitz, gossip, insider jokes‚Äîn u don‚Äôt demand fresh groundbreaking storytelling, u‚Äôll likely enjoy it. It‚Äôs made to entertain more than to deeply move or surprise in unexpected ways.üí´‚ú®",1
"Wow, such an amazing series. I didn‚Äôt have very high expectations in the beginning but I must admit that as a debut Director Aryan Khan just nailed it. Such an entertaining series. Raghav and Lakshya are amazing.",1

Well directed by young boy at such a young age as a directorial debut.
He knows what sells in market.
Certain scenes r very innovative.
Well done

Loved the show ! It shows that Aryan has a thinking mind and of course he gets help being a superstar son but all of us are supported in our journeys too so kudos to the team. My best Jr !!,1
"Seriously deserves a 5star . Ya the VFX was too much for the car chase but that got covered up with all other marvellous edits , comic timings and direction ! 
Ya cannot watch with family but a good series to watch , will keep you hooked every second .",1
"Watching Bads of bollywood, I am hooked since the first 10 mins, its tooo tooo tooo good. For someone whos a Bollywood fan, soldier soldier, tammali mara, this show is ammmmmazing. Its a walk down the memory lane. Wow Wow. Absolutely loving the show. Cant miss a minute! Hooked Hooked Hooked!!!!",1
"All the generational talent and unlimited exposure to international cinema and money and this is what you get from Aryan khan? It‚Äôs cringe AF and a wanna be star kid turned it into even shittier shit! Lakshya and Raghav are the only saving grace but what can you expect from the actors when the director is a noob with unlimited resources at his disposal? Don‚Äôt waste your time, I did that for us. Save yourself from watching this piece of utter non sensical crap on Netflix.",0
"Weak plot bad actors and all the film stars are stealing the spotlight for an already weaken plot and has no logic all of our hero ""asman"" does throughout the show has no logic behind his every action 1.tearing the agreement (legal offence),2. Fighting in the bar just for his show not being played, 3. Punching ajay talvar in an award show. One stupid thing after another the spotlight of all the camio is the thing that carries the show but it's also an double edged sword as it takes away people's attention from the main plot.",0
"the show was ok ok.
I enjoyed it a lot. I have to admit that 
Ariyan did a great job truly. As its his first diractal project. And he really succeed.
I am gonna rate this show 4/5.
Waiting for ariyan's future shows and projects...",1
"This series is one of the finest that I've seen in Bollywood, showcasing significant efforts from Aryan Khan. It's a fresh take on the industry, with Asman Singh's character portrayed brilliantly by lakshya lalwani The show incorporates a lot of Indian gali , especially the Delhi style, and is a true representation of Bollywood's badassery",1
Great creation and new beginning of the bollywood love this show and screen writing .. full appreciation to aryan khan to make this banger as he wants to be.. it connects everyone and he has that privilege to represent it and he never missed it... Love it n must recommend by me ü•∞ü•∞,1
"Bland, boring and borderline amateurish. Dialogues are a cringe-fest, most punchlines land flat, there is no prominent chemistry between the cast, Bobby Deol is playing yet again an angry middle-aged machiavellian, showing no range whatsoever. Someone with nimble deduction capabilities can predict the plot without much effort and then it will be like a long-haul flight journey in economy where you check ‚Äòremaining flight time‚Äô at least a thousand times. If ‚ÄòOm Shanti Om‚Äô (the song with countless cameos) were a series with no plot, then it would be called ‚ÄòB*****ds of Bollywood‚Äô!",0
5 hours of series but you will not feel bored for a single second. Extreme comedy and last twest was epic. Congratulations team and thank you for this movie üôè. You should come with some other projects too.,0
"He is the best web series I saw it last night, I laughed all night, father put me on the charge of getting up because everyone got up because of my laughter.  But the series is very good üòäüëç  You should work hard like ISI, Aryan brother, you will go a long way. I am with you brother ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä",1
"The Bads of Bollywood is an amazing series..I personally loved all the action and the twisted love story..but the PLOT was THE BEST I never saw this coming..The acting of newcomers and the experienced actors was amazing.The humour was also top level..The songs and the hook steps were WOW..Overall it was a OVER THE CLOUD experience..Aryan Khan has portrayed this very well and the graphics were too good..


5/5 for me MUST WATCH!!",1
As of the 1st directional and written movie of ariyan Khan is soo good. And the climax was so unexpected i really enjoyed the show. But as a negetive part this show wants to told us lots of story bcz of that it feels so clustered at the time .,1
Finished the entire series at one go‚Ä¶thanks to my holiday and the lazy evenings in the mountainsüòä‚Ä¶It‚Äôs a good series with lots of gaali and humour‚Ä¶.every character has done a decent job‚Ä¶.overall a good start for Aryan Khan‚Ä¶looks like a lot of effort has been put by the young boy‚Ä¶SRK Ka beta hai to Mehnat to poori karega hi‚Ä¶good start Aryan‚Ä¶waiting for more from you,1
"Ba**ds Of Bollywood is insanely Entertaining ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
Director - Aryan Khan cooked it üòÖüî•
He didn't hesitate to take on Backdrop things happen in Bollywood.

Raghav Juyal - Killed Itü´Çü´°

The day is not long when he going to Direct Shah Rukh Khan or any other fukcing actor on planet Earth... ü•≥",1
"Good. Not as good as expected. 3.5 stars.
I thought it would expose bollywood and money laundering aspect. But it's more like Drama, ego ride, romance and some action here and there. 
Lakshya and Bobby did a good job. Story could have been slightly better. Twist factor landed okay. Nonsensical plots but it's entertaining if you just take it as an entertainment.",1
Raghav and Manoj sir...were brilliant.. Anya the manager was awesome...Gafhoor and his paltan...were hilarious...I liked Ranveer singh Cameo..Rajat Bedi...and Freddy were too good...movie is slick..but has that Farah khan..Sajid khan...Manmohan desai..vibes...Aryan khan..has stamped  his arrival....there is a new kid on bloc...1 more thing...SRK and his son have shown maturity by launching as a director and nit in front of the camera,1
"Amazzzinnnngggg! Binged watched it!!! Aryan Khan did such a FAAAAAAB job with the direction and all the actors were BRILLIANT ü´° The puns, the clever and elegantly portrayed satire, every bit of it was truly such a pleasure to watch! Can‚Äôt wait for season 2!!!!!!",1
"I wasn't expecting anything from the show, but it turned out to be really good. It is so much better than normal bollywood movie. Best part of the show was Raghav and rest of the actors in the small roles were really good",1
"Aryaan Khan‚ù§Ô∏è
‚ÄúFor a first project, Aryan Khan has shown remarkable boldness and polish. Very few debut directors take such risks while keeping things this slick.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs managed to blend satire, humour and drama in a way that feels fresh ‚Äî a sign of a confident storyteller.‚Äù",1
"The Ba***ds of Bollywood is a strong debut. Its positives‚Äîsharp satire, confident voice, high production values, and earnest performances. It‚Äôs entertaining, provocative, and offers insight into Bollywood from someone both inside and outside.
This is worth watching!",1
"Entertainment on peak! The whole experience was full of fun, laughter, and energy from start to finish. Every moment kept me hooked, and it truly delivered beyond expectations. A perfect dose of excitement and joy!",1
"In a long time watched a comedy content that was really fucking funny, It's legacy He is son of the King himself, This man Aryan has talent real one I hope he can shine like his father, If you love pure comedy that is up to date it is the best series, bollywood should learn",1
Just too much fun‚Ä¶ not even a single minute u get bored while watching it‚Ä¶ and all the cameos were superb specially that Raghav and emraan scene üòÇ‚Ä¶ lead actors and every other actors were too good ‚Ä¶ climax was something u would never forget‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt familiar with Aryan game‚Ä¶ and  he is here not only to stay but he is here to rule üôåshow is just way too good ‚ù§Ô∏è,1

"It‚Äôs 12:16 am and I‚Äôve spent the whole day binging Badas of Bollywood‚Äîall for a glimpse of SRK, even if it‚Äôs just for a second. But what even is this show? Comedy? Action? Romance? Or a mix of everything that makes zero sense? A superstar‚Äôs son directed it, but honestly, it feels like a 6-year-old hopped off his video games and made this. Meanwhile, thousands of talented people are waiting for their shot‚Ä¶ and this is what we get? Disappointing doesn‚Äôt even cover it.‚Äù",1
"An interesting series, but no storyline, no benefit of taking so many Bollywood stars just to show your power. Too many bad words are not needed. If you pick the best parts and make a 2.30-hour movie it will be a super hit. The last episode didn't really sense. Not a family series and not a proper adult series. Sorry, interesting series again but you can make it less vulgar and simpler and better",1
"Such an amazing family drama i have seen today. All episodes are totally paisa vasool‚ù§Ô∏è mazaa aa gya saturday lag rha hai entertaining rha just because of aryan and his teams and other actors. All of them fabulous, agla season jaldi leke ayo bhai.",1
"I loved the series specially the story. Yes, there are some small mistakes , inconsistency in the writing and some not so good vfx in last episode but I think it's way better than anyother now days Bollywood stories. I Hope Mr.Aryan Khan sir will make a much bigger, better and more entertaining series or Film. I am waiting for next something great.",1
Ba***ds  of bollywood has been one of the best series I've watched this year. Well written. main  actor to the supporting actor everyone done fabulous work can't wait for episode 8 our season two,1
"Debut Masterpiece.Full of Entertainment,Emotions & Original Comedy.
Some dialogues can't forget until for long time.Raghav & (Avtaar) both r amazing.Aryan's Rocked.I think first nepo kid who is so talented.Srk is lucky to got have son like Aryan. 
& one more thing climax twist is so surprising.(10 out of 10).",1
"The Ba*ds of Bollywood ‚Äì Very Bad Show**

This was honestly a very bad experience. I had high hopes because the promos looked interesting but the show was a huge letdown. The story makes no sense most of the time and the characters are just boring. The acting is not convincing and the emotional scenes feel fake. It tries to be funny or smart but fails badly.

The show keeps changing its tone. One minute it's trying to be serious then suddenly it's trying to be a joke. It‚Äôs just confusing. Also it felt like they were trying too hard to be cool or edgy by using bad words and silly scenes but it just looked childish.

I was really disappointed. It felt like a waste of time. The promos promised more but the actual show was messy boring and over the top. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to anyone. Very poor effort and not worth watching.",0
"Great watch. Did not expect it to be so good. Great work Aryan Khan, your satire, irony and humor are right on point. The roast of Bollywood and an insight of an insider is so refreshing.",1
"The best ever web series in hindi and bollywood industry..
Plot of web series is really incredible 
Worth watching 
I really don't know how 5 hours and 18 minutes gone it's really attached..
Must watch 
Screen time 5 star
Story 5 star
Cast 5 star
Well directed and acted",1
"Honest Review.

Direction: Commendable Job Aryan Khan.
Script: Could have been much better. Last episode was pathetic.
Acting: All of them did a great job but Raghav Juyal was outstanding. Huge fan of his acting. He is the limelight of the series.

Watch it for Raghav. His acting deserves an award for it.",1
"Absolutely loved the movie! üé¨ Super entertaining ‚Äî every second felt like a climax and such a fun ride to watch. Already waiting for the next episodes! üî• #AryanKhan you rocked, and kudos to the whole team!",1
"Amazing show! I loved it. It was soo funny. The best friend scene singing was hilarious! The storyline was really unique and the plot  twist was sooo unpredictable.  

I'm excited to see Aryan Khan's next work!",1
"What punches, what action, what storyline and what performance!! Finally a series that gave me a mix of everything. Superb! Entertaining! Aryan Khan debut is mind-blowing! GHAFOOORR!! This series is going to be on a replay list for a very long time!",1
"Ba***ds of bollywood is a glossy, entertaining satire with great performances and fun celebrity cameos. The production quality is impressive and the humour works well, though the story feels uneven at times. A bold debut with promise ‚Äì worth a watch if you enjoy Bollywood‚Äôs glamour and behind-the-scenes drama.",1

"Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!
I‚Äôm not usually a fan of series, but this one really hit the mark. I enjoyed every single episode to the fullest.
Aryan Khan did a fantastic job ‚Äî truly one of the best series I‚Äôve seen so far!",1
"I just watched it because of all the publicities. 
However I didn‚Äôt like it. It's not truth of Bollywood first of all.
Its a total mess....weird drama. Everyone is hitting everyone anytime. 
Wah bhai wah.
But direction point of view- not bad. Good start Aryan Khan. 
But the story is bakwasss. Even acting is average.
I only liked Imran Hashmi part",1
"complete disappointment waste of time.. no connection in story.. The language is unnecessarily abusive and filled with swearing, which adds no value and is something most of us would rather avoid hearing. The story feels pointless, and instead of building substance, the director seems to have thrown big stars together just for ratings. Unfortunately, the talent was completely wasted ‚Äî this could have been so much better if it was handled with care. Overall, a garbage watch that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend.",0
ARYAN KHAN IS A LEGEND. It's been ages since I saw something so engaging and gripping. This is the vintage BOLLYWOOD we were waiting for. The climax is something no one ever expected. This is the Father of all twists.,1
"The series is okay-okay, it is just not my type. Just added so many strong actors to support it. Honestly, yes it will nailed it as they are big heroes - actors to support it. I was going through reviews before watching it and saw few reviews are identical. Funny.",1
"Best Series Ever In Bollywood By Respected Aryan Khan.......!!!
I love that series Aryan Khan gave a different look to every actor but his acting was shown in the old model in today's time and despite being a youth of today, Aryan Khan has given such a beautiful Series
MIND BLOWING 
............ARYAN KHAN ‚ô•Ô∏è",1
It's entertaining with comedy and thrill and suspense at the same time . The climax was unexpected. He turned them into siblings. I think his mood swings are bit too serious. Over all series is good .,1
"THIS SERIES IS PURE MAGIC .
ACTING,SCREENPLAY,WRITING AND DIRECTION -ALL TOP NOTCH.
EXCITING CAMEOS.
JUST WHAT YOU NEED FOR WEEKEND BINGE WATCHING.
A MUST WATCH , SO ENJOY THIS NETFLIX RIDE.
ARYAN KHAN HAS DEFINITELY STARTED HIS DIRECTORIAL WITH SPLENDOUR AND A BANG.",1
Finished watching the show and for sure Aryan did great at his first directorial debut!! Lived up to my expectations and all the characters were too good with their acting‚Ä¶ waiting for season 2‚Ä¶ lots of love and blessings to the whole cast of ‚ÄúThe Ba***ds of Bollywood‚Äù.,1
"It was a really good series, but seeing everyone‚Äôs cameo in the movie was even more fun. Still, the conversation always circles back to SRK ‚Äî the moment he appeared, the series truly lit up. But overall, the action and everything else was great too.",1
"Loved all the actors! Having seen their debut movie ‚ÄúKill‚Äùmust say both Raghav and Lakshya did a damn good job üëè The twist at the end was brilliant, and the whole series felt fresh, funny, and something new! Watched it mainly for Aryan üòç",1
Good viewing except for the unnecessary and unrealistic car chasing in the end part. The climax is really superb. Very good acting by lead pair and Bobby Deol. Engrossing web series but  dialogues lack humour . Overall watchable.,1
"It‚Äôs a good effort by Aryan Khan for his first movie. Lucky boy had lots of Bollywood actors plus Pappa & Mummy to back him up and nanny KJo. At the end I was wondering where‚Äôs Farah Khan? 
Next time son, please tone down on the B‚Äôs F‚Äôs and C‚Äôs.",1
"Might be going against the grain here.  On ep 2 and have started fast fwding it. Bad piece of writing, i havent heard so many f, bc and mc.  The dilogs are from the 80s movies.  Its so cheezy, its cringe.

If u erase srk's name from this production, then this wud not be so highly rated.  There are better stories that have come out Bollywood on Netflix.",1
I saw the entire series last night. It was okay. A one time viewing for me because it's SRK son first series. It's not appropriate for everyone. Mostly  the younger and wild generation would like the show. There's no running around trees and no kuch kuch hota hai feelings. It's more like hit and run. Watch it if you want to know about the show.,1
Its a nice series. Honestly I didn't thought that it would be this intresting I finished it in 1 day can you imagine how good it would be. I would really recommend you to watch this show truly addictive to me!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"I honestly did not liked the series.. i generally dont like movies r series which do not have a story.. this series also builds on just one line story‚Ä¶that also comes in the last episode.

Rest of the series are all abt bollywood mafia. 
I seriously watched the whole things in couple of hours.. 

Well yet mera review kaa kya farap padtha hain‚Ä¶ these bollywood nepo kids are zero‚Äôs in my opinion.
Pick a better story",1
"Decided to binge watch only 1st episod. But it just went with the flow. Worth the watch.
Raghav is a great addition. Mixture of drama action and a good laugh (you'll keep rewinding to rewatch and laugh)
Waiting for the 2nd part.",1
"Loved it overall but last episode not so much. Overall - wicked dark humor, cool action sequences and great acting by whole ensemble. Noteworthy direction by Aryan and writing by the team. But the twist was not to my taste. Brought the whole premise down for me.",1
"The entire show was well conceived and executed. Smart dialogs and action sequences with comedy really stands out. I loved the ending of the first season, totally unexpected. Each actor was outstanding !",1
"This series was absolutely amazing‚Äîso unexpected and engaging! I really enjoyed every bit of it, and the casting was just perfect. Great job to the whole team, I‚Äôm already excited for the next season!",1
"Great to see fresh faces as lead Hero and heroine.
Thankfully no GAY.
Lakshay and Bobby super hot.
Lead heroine  sweet.
Watched it for Rajat Bedi infact subscribed netflix for Rajat.
All praises to ARYAN for being so creative and distinct.
dialogue which stays #ghante ka baadshah",1
"Hmmm‚Ä¶ it was overall ok. Felt like more like a Bollywood party than a good engaging story. Got interesting in last 2 episodes but first few were boring in many places. I fast forwarded quite a few scenes to speed it up. 

In terms of acting loved Bobby Deol and main character played by Lakshya Lalwani.",1
"It was pure entertainment from start to finish! Everyone did an amazing job, not a single dull moment. A big round of applause for Raghav‚Äîhe‚Äôs truly a powerhouse of talent!",1
"Watched Ba*ds of Bollywood and honestly‚Ä¶ total disappointment. Expected a lot, but it‚Äôs all hype, no substance. Shows like Squid Game prove what real potential looks like. This one? I don‚Äôt know what to takeout from this series. Just another star kid project pushed into the spotlight. Didn‚Äôt work for me at all, bummer!!!!",0
"Absolutely brilliant fast paced masala entertainer. First time binge watched all 8  episodes of any series.  Aryan is poised to have a huge career, even bigger and better than his fathers. Looking forward to his next.",1
"So the hero here has back-to-back superhit films, producers running after him, and still he doesn‚Äôt even have his own car? Instead, he‚Äôs driving his friend‚Äôs old broken-down car every day. Doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all. In a show where they spend so much money just to show celebrity lifestyle and luxury, they forgot that even a normal person in India has his own car. And this hero, who casually buys a Land Rover, is shown using a junk car? Really?",1
"Must watch. Unexpectedly really good. Aryan has done a fantastic job. Everything comes together beautifully. The script, the cast, the dialogues. Series is funny, and gripping with right amount of drama.  üëèüëè",1
"Here‚Äôs a fun, dhamal-style movie review draft you can use (you can tweak tone depending on whether the review is positive or mixed):


It is not just a film, it‚Äôs a non-stop rollercoaster ride of laughter, drama, and masti! From the first scene itself, it grabs you and says ‚Äúbuckle up boss, ab hoga dhamaka!‚Äù üöÄüî•",1
"He did for me what entire Bollywood couldn't for the last decade, I've only been watching western entertainment, I've found everything Hindi or south so boring, repetitive and absolute cringe with no jokes landing from huge studious, I'm so glad I gave this show a try and binged it to hell. This is the Bollywood comeback to me.",0
Loved it man loved it Aryan bhai crazy man og series I have ever seen the climax was so killing bro so good great series everyone must watch and raghav sir u were rocking sir actually I am too a dancer sir someday I am gonna meet u sir have a lot to learn from u sir crazy acting sir dil seü´Ç,1
"now watching #TheBadsOfBollywoodOnNetflix. The first episode is so good, it went crazy and is such a fun breezy introduction and meta humour is working properly as well. Plus cameos don't feel forced too. Aryan Khan seem to have cooked. #TheBadsOfBollywood",0
"The Bads of Bollywood is so good and full of laughter.
Amid all the murder /mystery / thriller web series, this feel good web series is definitely outstanding. 
And cameos have been placed properly without a hampering storyline.",1
"I didn't expected aryan to be a director and writer. But after seeing this, he actually proved why he expected it from himself.

Series is really really good and 1st of its kind. Good work bro.",1
Watching a series after a long time just cuz it directed by srk's son aryan and manna padega accha debut kiya hai as a director aryan hai comedy acchi hai series m and entertaining bhi hai bhale hi masterpiece na ho but it's its still good ans enjoyable i knew it aryan will not disappoint üòÑ üëåüëç,1
"If I tell the truth, this series was so rubbish that it is not worth talking about. I watched this series completely only because the son of the person called King has made this series, that is why I remained with the entire series.The story in the series has no meaning, it has been used as a dirty word everywhere, before becoming a brother you should have thought once that you are the son of King Khan.Super duper flop, friend, if it does a little bit in small places then it will promote the actors in it, that's why it will do, otherwise it will be a super duper flop. Time waist",0
"Aryan Khan has put in a lot of effort into this web series, and it's clearly evident. Twist after twist, everything in this series is unpredictable. The entire Bollywood world is encapsulated in a single series, something only the king's son could pull off. This is truly a brilliant series.ü´∂üèª",1
"After such a long time, I‚Äôve come across a series this good! Hats off to Aryan Khan for creating such a masterpiece. Truly amazing work!! already looking forward to Season 2!",1
Excellent. A true entertainer after long. Humour in most unassuming way hits u in small packages throughout. Well thought execution. Loved it. Worth binge watching. Well done team. Great cast too. Balanced.,1
"Amazing Plot! Amazing Twists. The characters are well placed and written. Every next move is non predictable unlike the ordinary. The characters are so settled in their nature. And the ending, OH MY GOD!
Truly hysterical.",0
It was quite a fun and thrill ride. I wasnot optimistic about the series but after watching it i must say it was pretty good. Hope aryan makes new action series. He is quite good at directing.,1

To Aryan Khan ‚Äî A Visi 
Emran Hashmi entry so beautiful",1
"This is most rubbish show ever , chu***Yas of Bollywood . I got anxiety watching it. I watched for  a while thinking something good will come out. I bloody wasted my time . Even kids can act better. The new guys with a frog voice  I can't believe it's his real voice or is it dubbed . 

Zero rating what a waste of money , give to poor people rather than wasting it on making such a shit show.",0
"Superb all the best aryan such as a nice series Overall, this series is a must-watch for me. I‚Äôm definitely going to rewatch it, because I love to laugh, and it‚Äôs rare for a Hindi show to make me laugh this much, without feeling forced or overdone.",1
"This movie deserves a 100 stars.  Awesome, exciting, enjoyable,  excellent script.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  Aryan, well done.  I'm so looking forward to many more of your productions.  Pity,  there were only 7 episodes.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"If you love Bollywood with all its drama ‚Äî celebrity cameos, backstage glitz & mess, scandal, humour, and high doses of self-awareness ‚Äî this show is for you. It‚Äôs far from perfect, but it‚Äôs entertaining, bold, and filled with enough moments that make you laugh, cringe, and think. A strong start for Aryan Khan.",1
"What a series this is I really loved it and the acting is really amazing directed wonderfully but i love the acting of raghav juyal i am watching him from dance plus season 1 he is really great .
We want the second season please . 
Hats to Aryan Sir .",1
"Raghav/Lakshay friendship/chemistry was daam good.
Best cameo emran hashmi
Boby & manoj was good
Gafoor aka arshad entry was good & background music was too good
Sharad saxena character was to much boring
Forcefully add type

Climax was unexpected 
Aryan khan keep it up 
You will be good director 
Best of luck

"The series was made using bits and pieces of meta jokes but the overall product is quite pathetic. The jokes were forced and fell flat. Even Raghav, who is usually quite funny, failed to impress due to poorly written scenes and dialogues. 

So many cameos and not one seemed to impress. Of course it's hyped due to sarukh miya's pr but both the siblings are prime examples of how nepotism is ruining bollywood we once loved wholeheartedly.",0
"I am not a fan of web series and no time to watch doz episodes, took some time of fr watching d work of young fella Mr Khan on  dis sunday, imfact watched 6 episodes on fast trck and d last episode stopped me fr another hour fr its climax! Khan saab awesome mahn! Fk**n freak üòâ",1
"I absolutely loved the series and the plot twist oh my..... I didn't see it coming. But over all it was an amazing funny, entertaining series !!!! Hoping for a Season 2 soon.",1
"Just was scrolling through and gave it a shot- and I really enjoyed it. Different from regular stories. 
Most of the actors were good, best in my opinion was Raghav Junial. Awesome he was!!",1
"Big twist at the end Enjoyed watching the show worth it man appreciation the direction and cast acting was superb also appreciate Aryan for the first Film supurd direction. 
 
Enjoyed a lot!! Must watch üëç",1
Just loved it Aryan You just nailed it also the sharukh sir we thank you for support as a father to aryan sir. Yahh i can finally say ab maja aa rha h bollywood is back into action ‚ù§üòé,1
"nonsense and full bakwaas hai yeh! it was going well till the awards part.  write scripts which really inspires you, a meaningful ending, isn't that what makes cinema in bollywood magical. i just have no words to explain on how disappointed i am.  0/10. that's it . just a star for the legends who appeared.",1
Nice series loved to see it you rocked Aryan Khan like your father Shahrukh khan sir by directing and creating this series.and seriously whole cast of this series did a fabulous acting totally i say that super duper hit series I have ever seen .,1
This was amazing. Just every bit entertaining. A lot of heart has gone into this vision and the execution. Aryan Khan is super talented. HATS OFF.,1
"The bads of bollywood series ü§£
Recycled plots on repeat. Overacting olympics. ü§£ Stretched like chewing gum. Dialogues straight from whatsapp groups. Style over substance. Forced masala. Originality = zero. 

This series is nothing but recycled trash served with overacting, fake glamour, and endings that insult the viewer‚Äôs patience. Take medicine. üíä ü§ï wish I could give zero review.",0
"Finally, after a long time, something truly worth watching from Hindi cinema! A brilliant take on real-life incidents, packed with sharp wit and satire. Absolutely loved it!",1
"This is a spectacular series. A true Dramedy mixed with some amazing action till the very end. 

Plus the debuts of actors in every episode is a cherry on top!",1
Just watched this series.. full entertainment. Good job by new director Aryan Khan. Everybody has done an awesome job! Has shown the dirty politics of Bollywood in clear way. Good narration.,1
"You know it's garbage when they go heavy into promoting it ,left right center .Anyways it's Aryan Khan's first dumpster fire directorial venture , hopefully he will get better with time and Daddy Khan's got enough money and clout to fund more projects .Practice maketh perfect eventually so Aryan Khan's got the luxury to Fcuk Up and even get relaunched a couple of times .
In Short : It was lackluster and boring ,watching paint dry seems like a more entertaining proposition and a fun watch too after Baaaads Of Bollywood more like Bhaands of Bollywood.",1
"not my type of movies but it's very well written & executed & acting gud!
it's new, modern and interesting concept which take you out from the common same patterned boring movies of sh*t each time!
yeah unexpectedly gud one!",0
"This series was a complete disappointment. The plot felt dragged out and predictable, the characters were shallow, and the writing lacked any real creativity. Instead of building suspense, it relied on clich√©s and unnecessary filler episodes that went nowhere. The pacing was painfully slow, and even the acting couldn‚Äôt save it. Honestly, it felt like Netflix rushed this out just to fill its catalog rather than deliver real quality. I regret wasting my time on it.",0
"Looks very promising, actions and dialogue both are great plus some shots feel so real that make you think oh thats how it happens in bollywood - its a must watch for anyone who is curious how things work behind the curtains in bollywood.",1
"Amazing series. Spellbound story line. When asmaan and karishma eloped, the script looked so ordinary. But the plot turn is amazing. The cast is just so perfect, specially with bobby deol.",1
"The Ba*ds of Bollywood is bold, witty, and super entertaining! Aryan Khan‚Äôs debut nails the mix of drama, satire, and fun with a fresh take on Bollywood‚Äôs glitz and chaos. Totally binge worthy.",1
"Me and my friends watched this together and it was so fucking good and best series we've watches together by now, with 'What a twists! And 'What a plot!' moments and the whole damn bollywood we screamed for them. Best!",1
"Hats of to Aryan khan‚ù§Ô∏è
Great humour 
Absolutely perfect casting 
A typical Bollywood old school story line with 2025 touch in it.
Very entertaining series üòÉ 
Really enjoyed netflix after along time ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"Honestly, this series is overhyped. Poor stories that never really connect, weak execution, and too much noise around it just because it‚Äôs Aryan Khan‚Äôs debut. Feels more like a ‚Äúnepokid‚Äù launchpad than a genuine attempt at storytelling. Tried hard to look bold and edgy but ended up shallow and forgettable.",0
As a directorial debut of Aryan this is really nice and masala entertainer. Enjoyed the series but still expect more from him as he is son of the King Srk. He can create horror web series or thrill and suspense like baazigar or Darr.,1
"What a show mann....it was just dope..
No words..
The direction,  plot, meta references amd the cameos like a cherry on top...
Everything 10 on 10..

And the plot twist...this is what a plot twist isü§åüòÇüôå

Overall...baddass",1
How‚Äôs that for a debut‚Ä¶Shahzaada of Bollywood has arrived‚Ä¶Ayran brother you have done justice to the legacy and I can confidently say the flag of khan family is in the right hand‚Ä¶ May Allah bless you with all the success and keep you under His protection..,1
"i watched the show not knowing what to expect and started watching the show , it was funny crazy cool and had an awesome climax
as a person who likes bollywood quite a lot this was amazing
aryan did a great with this show def a good watch if u like bollywoodd",1
The 1st attempt at direction by Aryan khan commendable. Lead actor nd actress very impressive. Raghav nd Bobby deol  brilliant . Series is funny witty nd entertaining. Full paisa vasool,1
"The Bads Of Bollywood It was such a fun and entertaining show! üé¨üòÇ Full of laughs, drama, and nostalgia. A perfect mix of humor and filmy madness ‚Äî totally worth watching! üåü",1
Wow...Aryan Khan really hit first ball six..looking forward for his next venture...because now expectations will be much high...till than me and my wife reallly njoyed each episodes of netflix series..Congratulations to entire cast n crew!!,1
"Tried my best, but couldn‚Äôt watch beyond 2 episodes. They have tried every single possible promotion strategy though. They have even got Tanmay react on board. Kudos to that. But yaa didnt work for me!",1
"I love it! It has comedy and swag. I love the actor‚Äîdon‚Äôt know who he is, but his acting is very good. I kept waiting for season 2. When is it coming? Please upload it fast, I can‚Äôt wait üòç",1
"Honestly watching bad**** of bollywood  show was fantastic. Nd  really good
 Raghav u rocked it . Ur acting jst make  speechless . 
Specially as a Emraan Hashmi frnd 
Sara bollywood ak taraf and yes Emraan Hashmi ak taraf 
‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"Really a fantastic movie. Can't believe that it's the first movie of Aaryan khan üî•.
Nice story and nice acting all 10/10üéâ.
Can't wait for the second season üí´üçï.",1
Definetly worth watching. No doubt excellent casting... But it's optimization of the cast and Cameos that stand out. Twist at end is not for everyone but that's what the title is Abt after all . It adds up.,1
"Love the cinematic tone, VFX, and the storytelling. We are seeing something new after a decade in Bollywood.

Thanks Aryan for this amazing series. Eagerly waiting for the season 2!",1
"Guts !!! Aryan has the guts to make a series like this . Showing nepotism , struggle of veteran actors & bollywood mafia needs lots of guts. But ... climax of the series  was awful for me (personal view). 
Brother sister relation between hero aasman & Karishma  , I couldn't digest. Climax could have more interesting rather than this .",0
"A well written and directed show. Everything the show delivers has a truth in it put along with humor to make it light. Overall, very entertaining and fun to watch!",1
"Crazy show. Entertainment to the fullest. No dull moment, some memorable cameos placed perfectly. Execution at it's best. Topping these the brilliant performances by all the actors.",1
"Absolutely loved it! Finally, something in Bollywood that feels new, daring, and full of energy. Brilliant storytelling, powerful acting, and such a unique concept. Highly recommended!",1
"Kitna bechoge apne zammer ko jo 5 star rating de rahe ho is gandgi ko.
Kahi bhi gaali use karna  , third class acting , pathetic script
i have stopped watching the series after 1st episode.

those who r spending the precious time of life on such b grade series. please spend some time on yourself and try to find some meaning.",0
Absolutely mind-blowing! Aryan Khan‚Äôs debut is pure fire The story keeps you hooked till the end and every episode ends with a perfect twist  Bollywood finally feels fresh again,1
"Honest Review.

""The series has a well-written story with engaging scenes and good comedy. Although it contains some slang language, overall it is highly entertaining and will surely make you laugh.""",1
"Omg , unbelievable what a direction , 7 episodes u can‚Äôt leave it for later , just no words, ragav , lakash, bobby, u guys nailed it , specially Arian khan , welcome to new world and best of luck for your next chapter as a hero , u deserve it , well done, keep it up.",1
"Only inappropriate thing was showing boy doing masturbation 

I mean , should have at least give a warning on episode that this kind of content will be shown. 

We thought srk son presenting it so it will be a family show. 
Come on ......


On the contrary, 
twist in the last episode was a good writing.",1
The young debutant director Aryan Khan has totally KILLED it . He‚Äôs seen this industry closely and it shows in this spoof on Bollywood. Look forward to getting more from him . Well done boy !!!,1
The series was amazing. I really enjoyed it . It was too good . I loved it. Hope so we would see some more spice and twist and entertaining series like this.,1
"It‚Äôs a decent show with time-pass dark humor. The comedy works well, though the show dips a bit in episodes 4 and 5 before picking up the pace again. Overall, it turns out to be a good watch",1
"Entertaining. Ghafur was epic. Boby Deol's best performance, looked very composed and clean dialogues. Though they could have avoided excessive abusive language.",1
"Totally pathetic 

This series is a mess from start to finish ‚Äì a jumbled, uninspired concoction that fails on nearly every level.

It‚Äôs is a cinematic misfire. Unless you're getting paid to watch it (or are a completist for some bizarre reason), stay far, far away. On a scale of 1-5 (where 1 is ""meh"" and 5 is ""omg avoid""), I'd give it a solid 0",0
"I watched today ....it's fun and emotion ....watching Raghav always fun ....chachu is funny ....fun and emotions .....

Hero and heroine does fantastic job .....
Aryan as a director üëè üëå 

All cast have done good work üëè üôå üëç",1
"Most entertaining series .

Good job Aryan Khan 
Your parents must be super proud and rightfully so .",1
Absolutely loved it. Watched the entire show twice. Hilarious. So happy seeing it. Full on entertainment. Raghav is ammmmazing and a feast to watch. Lakshya is another beauty. Loved the show. Way to go Aryaaaaaaan khaaaaaan ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°,1
"Aryan did an amazing job! The plot twists were unpredictable, and the humor hit perfectly. Every actor brought their best, making this series a fun and thrilling ride.",1
Amazing show to watch. I got completely hooked. Saw all 7 episodes in one go. I would love to see season 2 of this show as well.,1
Very well made series. Hats off to Aryan and all characters have done great job. The new guy is a really good actor,1

Love  is redefined and I found love in every bit of it",1
"I think Ba***ds of Bollywood is one of the best Bollywood shows I‚Äôve watched this year. I say this NO exaggeration!!! It was so refreshing, satirical, full of Easter eggs and references, ironic humour and honestly and wish that it broke all the records",1

Probably the best Hollywood series in this past few years. Kudoos to Aryan Khan Great job Bro really. Unexpected but probably I guess is series to MAA HI CH***i‚Ä¶,1
"Watching this not expecting much but 
So pleasantly surprised. If this is the level
Of work you are going to do we the viewers are in for a treat.love from Scotland and all the best for the future.",1
"Very well executed, watched all 7 episodes in one go keeps you captivated, unfortunately would not watch with family. Thoroughly enjoyed the series well done to Aryan Khan on his successful debut in my opinion.",1
I loved the show you should watch it and don't bother those unnecessary hate which is spread by people who don't have any work accept pulling someone down. Love the way he picturise the things which are  so dark and hidden.,0
"Good quality satire and meta commentary on lives of Bollywood,Fun and Raw to watch.The nepo star kids playing the roles perfectly by subverting the real nepo-politics. 

Must watch,Good job son of SRK",1
"As boring as Suhana Khand Debut. Lifeless , forced humor, constant cursing making it look cool. Waste of time and money. Please save your time for some good movie or series.


I am shocked to see so many 5 star reviews. Even for a SRK movie we don't get such reviews.",0
"What the hell did I just watch? The acting was flat, the script was awful, and the whole thing felt like a boring, pointless series. I honestly don‚Äôt get how this even made it past production. And then I see it‚Äôs rated 7.8 on IMDb? How on earth is half the population liking this trash? Feels like a total waste of time.",0
"Epic. Lakshay and raghav from warrior high , MTV and DID, zee. Seeing them on Netflix ‚ô•Ô∏è. The direction , fun , jokes are literally landing. It's a fun pack to watch.",1
"Average climax screenplay but initially it was perfect. Raghav did a great job. Still spark was missing in the end. 

Shahrukh sir I love you ‚ô•Ô∏è",1
"It was good. I was giving Om Shanti Om rather than Luck by Chance, which a lot of people thought this movie might be like. Because of the whole newcomer entering the industry plotline. And just like OSO - it kinda reinforces the myth that acting is in the ""genes.""",1
"Reaaaallly nice spicy, Asmaaan‚Äôs acting is awesome and lyrics are the best with the great climax. Nicely directed too. Great series to watch",1
Mind-fucking-blowing kudos to Khan and his family. It‚Äôs impressive work by the debutant director. I wish he directs a movie soon because he is ready to win awards like his dad.,1
"Had me glued to the screen from 3am till 7am. Crazy show, creative comedic scenes and a bunch of cameos. Dialogues hit spot on and didn‚Äôt feel like they were forced.",0
"This is peak brain rot. A bad show made worse by low grade humor and unnecessary double entendres. The plot went nowhere and the end twist was just for shock value (and am not talking about the title reference here) 
I could say a lot more but I'll stop here.",0
Engaging. Entertainment. Humour at peat. Satire. Action. Even I did not overthing or try to guess next move or next seen. It's that much engaging. Overall good. Story is so simple. But still direction feel different.,1
"‚≠ê 1/5
This series is a total disappointment ‚Äî hyped with the promise of a Tamannaah song (Ghafoor) that never actually exists in the show, making the entire promotion feel like a cheap publicity stunt. What we get instead is a weak, dragging boring drama with recycled plots, poor writing, and zero freshness. Misleading marketing plus a dull story makes this a complete waste of time.",0
"I personally liked the show it was full of entertainment. Especially creating something for first time and it turns out to be so good. Aryan, now you have set the bar high.",1
"One of the best web series I have seen, Aryan is a true genius as he has cracked the social media algo. 
It is a banger. Must watch!!",1
"Absolutely amazing humour! I loved the cast, the songs and the plot! It's a must watch! Aryan Khan has indeed done an excellent job!",1
"Finished #TheBadsOfBollywoodOnNetflix üé¨ #AryanKhan has nailed it ! üòàBrilliant use of the entire cast & the music is pure fire.Every dialogue hits..but Raghav‚Äôs line stole my heart- ‚ÄòAkkha Bollywood ek taraf, Emraan Hashmi ek taraf‚Äôüî•‚ô•Ô∏èBanger of a series! 

#TheBastardsofbollywood",1
Aryan has done a brilliant job by not only addressing the issues and politics of bollywood but also the irony of both the nepo and non nepo kids. The comedy timing was amazing along with brilliant dialogues,1
"What did I just watch? Not a series. Not a show. This was an eruption. A firecracker of sarcasm, a thunderstorm of wit, and a glorious, unapologetic parade of everything Bollywood is accused of ‚Äî nepotism, arrogance, cringe, swagger ‚Äî turned into pure cinematic gold.

It‚Äôs raw. It‚Äôs messy. It‚Äôs insulting. It‚Äôs brilliant. The kind of drama you can‚Äôt look away from, even when it makes you squirm. This isn‚Äôt a debut, this is a declaration.

Aryan didn‚Äôt just make a series; he staged a coronation!!!",1
"This season of Bollywood was totally a Bullshit! No story, no direction - it was like a big mess. I think all the good reviews are paid for - nobody likes this crap honestly.

It's the worst Bollywood season I've seen. Waste of time watching it. Don't bother, you'll just get bored. They just threw some famous actors together and made a big disaster.",0
"Amazing show 
Best best all episodes 
Comedy, action , and last episode climax wow
Last me Jo twist Aya ha Bhai shab asa twist Socha b ni tha 
Can't wait for next part plzz jldi sy next part lao",1
"It's the most bollywood series on bollywood. Om Shanti Om meets Gangs of Wasseypur. 
Good looking actors, Mass entry, good songs, a love story, a car chase sequence and fight scene climax. The ending is something which you won't see coming.",1
It is exiting and good series interns of bollywood reality shown and Climax is unpredictable. BUT YES ARYAN KHAN direction and The Cast and Members of this series have done amazing job üëçüëç would love to see Season 2 as soon as possible and more series.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,1
Most hilarious and fresh show on internet today. Enjoyed a lot. Love the mind boggling end. Very well written and direction. Binge worthy.,1
"The Bads of Bollywood is making waves with its daring, flashy, and unapologetically entertaining approach. Audiences are particularly loving how it playfully critiques the industry itself ‚Äî from nepotism to scandals ‚Äî with a sharp, self-aware tone.",1
"Acting is really depends on the director,by which an actor can do his best.
The only one Aryan Khan superb bro as your father always been.
Love you",1
"Absolutely worth of watching. That dialogue ""Sitaare to bahot hain but Aasman sirf ek"" I love that. Congratulations Aryan for your endless journey as the director of bollywood. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"It was fun and I did like the starting but the climax was so lame I was taken aback.... I mean I did enjoy watching it but the climax was so weird. It was all cringe after the filmfirst episode but before that was entertaining tbh. I just think that the climax would've been better rather than giving it a ""step sibling"" angle orelse it would've been the best series I've ever watched. Rest everything was great....",1
Great start of Aryan khan and the most wonderful show ever. Awsome work by the actors. Most importantly Bobby Deol. He looks hot üòçü•∞üòò,1
"I thought this would be like the bullshit ibrahim and khusi kapoor did , but wow aryan really proved himself so thoughtful and dilected so well . Aryan khan will be the best director in india imo.",1
"over all best frictional story. masala. but last mein jo twist hai , hat's off Aryan khan now i understand THE BAS###D OF BOLLYWOOD, TITLE. very genius move.",1
"A very good entertainment, this is one of those shows that I would want to watch again. it was a really good one, Actors have done a great job! along with Director",1
The plot twist had me gagged. An absolute masterpiece. Really need more series like this from Bollywood. Personally loved episode 6. Classic,1
"All reviews are fake, purchased. I can easily understand the language of purchased reviews. I am big fan of SRK but I watched first episode of this show and I thought what shit did i watch?????????? And their failure is they had to purchase reviews. Lol! Boring af!",0
"I hardly give any review on movies, but this one I find it entertaining. After a long pause Bollywood gave a crazy entertainment package. 

Fun Unique Entertainment ....",0
"Apart from the excellent performances by the entire cast, Aryan Khan‚Äôs debut direction has been exceptional. The punches and dialogues added just the right spice to an already well-prepared dish.",1
"The Bads of Bollywood shines with glossy production and starry cameos, but the story falls flat.
It leans too heavily on tired Bollywood clich√©s, losing freshness and bite.
The satire promises edge yet stumbles with uneven tone and weak humour.
Overall, flashy on surface but not fun or impactful enough ‚Äî a one-time watch.",0
What a blockbuster series love it aryan the way you have directed no one can like you does nobody can feel this is your debut and the cameos I just the you have use and twist is very enexceptable this is just the beginning many more to go,1
"Aryan Khan has just lived up to the legacy ‚Äî truly baap ka beta, sipahi ka ghora!
It was a complete blast. Such a fantabulous job!",1
"I tried to watch this series, but from the very first episode, they showed an exaggerated building jump with no safety measures‚Ä¶ no harness, no net. It‚Äôs 2025, media should know better. When all ages watch, we need more realism. Scenes like this can influence kids, and media creators need to take responsibility.",1
Broooooo after work I‚Äôve started watching the show and I really messed up my sleep schedule because of it. It‚Äôs bingeworthy!! Aryan Khan did an amazing job creating the show,1
The Ba***ds of Bollywood is a very great so it is well directed and written by Aryan Khan it was very fun for watching the show I love the show it is amazing well created by Aryan Khan wonderful creation by Aryan Khan and its its first time and he did it very good so love the show very much,1
"A heap of F word , swearing ,abuses 90% of time when they weren‚Äôt even required as per situation. Theme, scenes and characters seemed like a bouquet from Hollywood and content from OTT.
The series seems to be a result of excessive OTT watch by creative team .",1
"It was the first movie of Indian cinema were three khans an emraan hashmi, ranbir kapoor, ranveer singh,ss Rajamouli, Karan Johar, bobby deol, arshad warsi and many other actors was also there and makes the series excellent",1
"I just love ittttüíóAryan khan you did ittt perfectlyüî•Boht achi series hai (action,funny ,suspense!! all in one. (Must watch!!)",1
"Though making of films in Bollywood may sometimes include crude language, bringing that same filth into a web series Bads of Bollywood‚ÄîDirected by Shahrukh Khan‚Äôs son‚Äîis both forced and shameful. It is disappointing to see such content being launched with applause and praise from esteemed figures who should have known better.",0
Outstanding performance of all the character but at the same time Aryan as a director... Super se bhi upper fantastic concept and humorous story it's feel like movies series...,1
"From Nepal,
It's just a mind blowing series and love this series...ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ it's have comedy, action,romance and all and I am biggest fan of Shah Rukh Khan but when I saw this series I am also fan of Aryan Khan he is mind blowing director,writer and entire team was mind blowing loving this....",1
"Can't even complete 1 episodes! The review are all paid I guess! If a father can open a court midnight for bail, then what's the big deal of buying fake reviews!
Just a time waste show, overacting, non sense drama, unrealistic stunt, cringe dialogue!
Just intolerable!",0
"If I had the option, I would give a negative rating. This is one of the worst series I‚Äôve ever watched. The 5-star reviews you see are nothing more than paid promotions. Only the best part is Raghav Jurail's acting in this series nothing else.",0
"Cringe is the right word. 
It truly looks an amateur film school or university project. 
And what's with unnecessary ""maa behen"" ki gaaliyan? 
I feel sad that bollywood has forgotten it's own essense. It is all an ""instagram"" reel on a big screen.",0
loved the show. So refreshing. Raghav juyal is awesome in the series. what a unforseen climax. the music is so melodious and peppy. it is a must watch.,1
"Shit show. Absolute waste of time. After ruining the movies, now Bollywood gonna make shit web series.
Just 0 stars, had to give one as google won‚Äôt let me post 0 star.",0
"What a wonderful and fantastic Bollywood web series! The story, acting, and music were all amazing. Truly one of the best series from Bollywood",1
"Just wow..üëå..‚ÄúThis is the first time I‚Äôve watched a Bollywood series like this, directed by Aryan. His work was impressive, with no noticeable mistakes ‚Äî a well-executed direction overall.‚Äù",1
"The best show i watched this year, it was full of comedy, attractive scenes, you can‚Äôt get bored for a second even, spot on the best direction by Aryan khan as a debutant!",1
Watching this series was so much fun. I've not seen such good comedy movie in while. Totally worth watching,1
"With the number of stardom featured in the movie, it better be worth some watching! Great director, watchable I guess but to say it's the best series of 2025, like many claim in here, I wanna believe they're paid...perhaps I'm not cause I didn't think it was worth the hype!! Though great direction and watchable :)",1
THIS SERIES IS THE BEST ITS VERY VERY FUNNY I LOVEEEE THE PERFORMANCES AND I LAUGHED ALL THE WAY EVERY EPISODE SOMETHING EXCITING OR FUN HAPPEN YOU NEVER EVER GET BORED OF THE EPISODES YOU ALL SHOULD WATCH ITS A MUST.,1
Utter garbage and it‚Äôs a copy of American show Entourage with stupid Indian Bollywood twists. It‚Äôs not original. Thank god for his dead‚Äôs wealth. What‚Äôs up with the ugly and nasty title song. How about something unique and original !,0
"What a absolute joke! Go ahead and waste your time! 

Totally shit cinematic, dialogues straight from memes group! 
Story line! What are you taking about there is no story line! 

That acting and direction for that narcotics cop is just utterly nonsense!",0
"Fabulous job done by Aryan Khan, hidden ‚Äú reality ‚Äú jokes where sooo good. Bobby and Lakshay where impressive. Story line is decent but the humour is next level.",1
"Hats of to casting team they selected the actors very wisely,Raghav Juyal & Lakshy jodi kill it this time aswell no one can say its made by a debut director totally refreshing",1
"The Series was stupid as fuck. So called Awards scene was Farah Khans copy. Waste of time. Series was too predictable. If there were no huge stars, the series would have not been aired. Couldn't expect more from a Nepo kid.",0
"At the end what was that !!‚Ä¶.. LOL.... nice one... all the qualities of Bollywood present in this series... really liked it...
Raghav nailed all the scenes... Nice bro",1
Full entertainment üòé! Great work by the entire star cast of Bollywood. Kudos to Mr. Aryan Khan for his outstanding direction.,1
"if you want to laugh, then watch this series , one of the best from bollywood in recent times. don‚Äôt miss this web series its so fucking good.",1
Loll ‚Ä¶ Aryan khan‚Äôs drugged himself for good tbh . It was just fab I loved it and ngl it is too good for a debut . Just loved it ü´∂üèªü´∂üèª,1
These people are hitting new low with every attempt .. with the title itself they introduce their well beings and upbringings . These thugs of bollywood could do everything for money.  No wonder they are now no match with south movie industry.,1
I will only keep the subscription of netflix cuz i don‚Äôt want to miss the next chapter the best series i have ever scene thanks to Aryan khan for giving us such this type of material,1
Fully entertainment... music is awesome.. director smart..the guest appearance present was awesome.. overall...good to watch eyes and ear satisfying...good web series ‚ù§Ô∏è,1

Entertainment‚Ä¶ Entertainment‚Ä¶ Entertainment‚Ä¶ and this is a paisa vasool show of OTT for sure. Aryan Khan knows how to entertain audiences with a simple script and larger than life presentation. ü§òüèªüëç,1
"Just no depth in the movie, they just brought starts in every episode to pull the audience 
I felt no emotions in it 
Like no feeling 
Can't relate 
We all know about these bollywood things already, nothing new in it
I feel it's fake PR
And just promotions from all the biggie stars
There was nothing mysterious or something i would feel new to know 
I was excited to watch it because of the lot of promotions from all the stars but it's a complete nahh after watching.",0
Superb. Proud of you Aryan. Proved to be Jr. SRK and beyond. God bless you beta. Very Good series. Next time make a movie.,1
"Most of em hating it without reason. But besides that it's just a rollercoaster ride that I liked, Lakshay and Raghav chemistry is I would say cherry on top it's a 5 out 5 for me.",1
"Masterpiece of series the great series of this year & all actors are really appreciate,

"What a Show. Class Direction heads off Aryan Khan you done the greatest job.. what a story,Direction,Acting and Music...
Dying to watch season2 or any other project by the Director Aryan Khan........",1
A really good watch! I love seeing Karan Johar he is shaping Bollywood series making them such an interesting watch! I hope he never retires,1
I think this TV show is absolutely waste of your time. I would not recommend anyone even I would rather watch a high-quality news or a documentary over this. No story it‚Äôs clueless. I have no idea what‚Äôs going on. It seems like when you have a lot of money and less idea this is how the product comes out.. do not watch. Do not watch. Do not watch.,0
"I like the show, something new, something fresh. I would not say its perfect but well done Aryan Khan. Raghav Juyal acting was bang on.",1
"Absolutely loved it. If you care about inner workings of Bollywood in a more comical and satirical way. Go for it. 

Cameos are cherry on the cake.",1
Excellent work Aryan khan. Funny & Enjoye Raghav JUGAL very funny bro. Keep working hard and reach on your goals bro.,1
Liked it. Watched the full series at a time. Aryan khan has done a great job! Lakshya and Raghav both were awesome!,1
"Enjoyed every episode. Awesome Acting by everyone. And Manoj Phawa ,Raghav n Arshad Warsi are on a Next Level. LOVED IT",1
"The Bads of Bollywood is a bold, flashy satire that lifts the curtain on Bollywood‚Äôs glitz, gossip, and power games. Packed with star cameos, sharp humour, and high drama, Aryan Khan‚Äôs debut web series is an entertaining binge-watch you shouldn‚Äôt miss.",1
"I dont revoew for movies and series much but this series deserves it oh my god what a series mindblowing screenplay what an act conrats to all the crew for making this wonderful series ,continue making such great contents",1
The best show i ever had watch what a mind blowing work on this show really the best climax thriller show. I really appreciate aryan khan who made this masterpiece üéâüíó,1
"Something different 
Something beyond expectations in bollywood 
Something old but still makes you feel fresh 
Superb acting by everyone 
Standout performance by lord Bobby Deol, Raghav & lakshya
Superb direction 
A bold and great move",1
Awesome Aryaan Khan sir‚ù§Ô∏èüî•One of the unique series you made .. you make us aware how difficult for a new one to servive in Nepo industries and it's true..,1
"Aryan Khan‚Äôs directorial debut is good BUT the language in this movie is soooooo VULGAR, that he does not to use that many words in each and every dialogue  by every character is way too much.
Even in western movies this doesn‚Äôt work.
He could have used his skills better way!",1
"Aryan Khan beats his father in creating senseless work. This marks the end of 3 Khans era as there's no next gen to take khans legacy forward. While on one hand all 3 Khans are done with their career, there's no next gen to take it forward. The End of Khans Bollywoods.",0
"Witty , engaging and refreshing. Well done to the team. Raghav man of the match and the guys who played Bobby Deol's son. Debut century by khan jr. It's a ba****ds show indeed ...üëç",1
Quite fun!! I didn‚Äôt like the main girls acting and casting for some reason. Also tht police officer in ep 1 or 2 did too much overacting!!,1
For last decade I didn't watch any web series or movies from Bollywood. But I like it alot . Great work guys,1
"I‚Äôm shocked at how most people in Bollywood speak so crudely. They casually use words like ‚Äòf* up‚Äô all the time. In comparison, normal people and social culture are far more decent. Honestly, Bollywood should be ashamed.",0
"I don‚Äôt like that. Years ago we saw movies like that. It‚Äòs not a new idea. But a young boy like aryan to make it, it‚Äôs a big work.
Good luck in the future",1
"Fun watch 
Aryan khan 
Good job
You have risen like the Phoenix and you will do extremely super.
I definitely binge watched BOB.üëçü•∞",1
"Extremely boring and each and every dialogue of every character has gaali  in it. 
At d end very hopeless suspens revealed.  And

What a series man what a series this series is made by aryan khan and his father is sharukh khan . Most off the actors are in this series so much comedy so much drama and language is as a title badass ( THIS SERIES IS FOR 18+ NOT TO WATCH WITH FAMILY ONLY SUITABLE FOR 18+ ),1
Very good show  as far  just saw 3 episodes fully entertaining I will complete rest of the episodes tonight but hats off to Aryan khan his director‚Äôs vision is very good,1
"The actors did a great job, and the direction was impressive, especially for a debut director. Not a single scene felt boring‚ÄîI thoroughly enjoyed the entire series.",1
"This Directorial debut of Aryan Khan failed to impress . Nothing new except for abusive & filthy language . 
Was expecting much much better from SRK 's Son , but he also served rubbish & filth. Could not watch it for more thn 10 minutes ... Waste of time .",0
"It's a fabulous web series, entertainment, music, & cinematography is mind-blowing. Aryan khan is proved our direction, it's a long race horse. Congrats @aryan khan",1

"Very very entertaining movie..Aryan u did wonderful ...and Aasmaan such a really handsome man...n also a realistic actor...
Boby sir tussi cha gye..love u",1
"Bekaar story hai.. waste of time.. Aakhir me pata chalta hai ki Jo love story hai wo bhai bahan hai.. very bad scripting.. not good at all..

If you don‚Äôt have anything then ok ok to watch.. but sometimes better to choose old watched movies like Hera pheri n all",1
"What a great watch, absolutely entertaining! This is what Bollywood lacks, glad someone took it up. Good story this series had, kept me hooked üíØ",1
"Just started watching the show and I'm sorry I'm struggling to connect..I don't get this abusive humour, weird close up camera work, below average dialogues..feels like a home video where everyone who cud be included is included..what is the period the city the intention the issue..if you can't establish all this in first 20 mins..you've lost me..sorry.",0
Entertaining ... lakshay lalwani is a hero package from looks to voice to screen presence...but so much fake reviews here for aryan... afterall he's a nepo at the end of the day...,0
"I don‚Äôt understand why Bollywood needs to use such bad and filthy language in movies. Right from the beginning, the film was filled with offensive words, which made it very uncomfortable to watch. I had started the movie in my living room, but due to the excessive use of foul language, I had to stop it midway.",0
"One word mind-blowing ü§©
big thanks aryan make this web series
next king of bollywood Aryan Khan üëë

"Aryan khan , new start as a director , but this series is not up to mark . Filthy Badwords in the movie . Can't watch with kids . Stryker line is OK. Direction was average and story line was ok .",0
"Hilarious, super entertaining, totally binge-worthy! Laksh and Raghav ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è every peeformance was spot on, the BGM was exceptional. And did I mention how hot Laksh looked in every frame??",1
It's all hyped guys. Don't watch it because of PR tricks. It's like a Om Shanti Om in series... There is no story or content or any connections. I started watching it for Raghav but I could not complete it because it's so bullshit.,0
Full of adults jokes but good acting direction love it Aryan Khan. Want to see u like hero. With own movie direction love u alots.,1
The best scene was when Aasman was running away with Ajay‚Äôs daughter ( Bobby deol character) lol and his son was playing jerk off game üòÇ I laughed 30 minutes non stop,1
Very very funny and adorable series....the cast is amazing....the dialogues are very witty and hilarious....scenes and settings are so beautiful....and on the whole a very very well directed...very carefully scripted and beautiful series....Congratulations to the young and the dashing director of the series Aryan Khan....for his debut venture.....Stay Blessed always....,1

"Grippy, hilarious and bursting with self awareness. Aryan Khan has a sense of humor and he‚Äôs proven it. What a watch!",1
"Unwatchable because of the horrendous acting by the youngsters. Senior actors still managed to keep their dignity in this, through their skills. Couldn't get past the third episode.",0
"Absolutely cinema at its best.
Aryan stunned by his directoral skills... Raghav juyal was the pick to watch.. 
Awesome timepass.",1
I seriously regret watching this web series. Aryan khan u could have done better than this. The only good acting I saw was from Raghav n bobby sir n rest were I don‚Äôt know doing what. N story kya he thi ????,1
"The ending could be a bit indigestive brain rot, but overall this series was a massy masala. Weather it was BGMs, screenplay, cameos, plot or the story, everything was so perfectly presented.",1
"Aryan has done the perfect job.
What a proud moment for his father.
Good luck champ you have a long way to go.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",1
Great performance by whole characters in The Ba***ds of Bollywood. And what a great work done by Aryan Khan....I mean amazing üëè‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"Just No
Couldn't watch it, no more
Draining
Too much money  doesn't make you smart enough to make art
Real talent is required
Unfortunately money or influence can't make up for actual skill
No matter who you are
I didn't expect anything good but still
If you want to take revenge on your friends, dare them to watch it",1
One of the worst series ever. Only the charsi son of a bollywood bhaand could have made this shit series full of slang and unparliamentary language. When one cast says Maa Chudaaye I actually said in my Mind Aryan apni Maa Chudaaye,0
Really enjoyed the show. What a twist! The acting and direction was on point. Super funny and bold content....,1
"Full on paisa wasool ..it's worth binge watch ott series....very engaging, suspenseful and the best has been played by raghav juyal...he's truly a package, very versatile and passionate actor...",1
Great direction and story writing what essence of acting they have added great work guys great work Aryan brother and Team Red Chilli entertainment keep on bringing such amazing ideas,1
"It's funny when karan johar said himself movie mafiaüòÇüòÇ lol South and Marathi movies getting awards on international level, nothing but they create their barbie world for themselves and giving awards to each otherüòÇüòÇ",1
"Super duper entertainment. Aryan hits a sixer in first ball. I do watch many OTT shows, but this is best ever.",1
"Unique story. Disgusting plot twist. Inspired from oldboy in a disgusting way - that's the spoiler. 

The writer was confused and didn't know what was the series about.",0
"Please don't waste your 7 hours better to watch one episode of coffee with Karan that will be more entertaining. The worst thing is climax (hero and heroines are sibling)and the role and dialogues of lead actress brother, it's nasty. Overall don't watch it.",0
It was ok not Good. Nothing new. Some old copy and paste scenes and lacks originality. A lot of abusive language unnecessarily. It was good in bit and peaces and chemistry was good in between lead pairs,1
Overall I enjoyed the show. It's melodramatic. Although editing may would have been better but Aryan khan delivers his first project quite impressive.,1
Best series of all time i love it so much and the afford of aryan khan is awsome and i love his direction. Waiting for season 2,1
"It is no satire except for the revolver movie that aasman debuted. It has twists like daily soap of balaji telefilms.. 
Only thing good about the movie is shaumik.. but he hardly had 10 scenes in total",1
"Incredibly scripted with an essence of sugar n spice.... Dialogues are super awesome and comedy timing is perfect... 
Want more of Aryan Khan 's direction....",1
"Man...this was not up to the mark , really disappointed...even when the series' got bad all I was looking up for tamanaas song, but they just played really bad promotional strategy. By not releasing the song . Anyways all the best , don't waste your time ...all these reviews you are seeing are just paid ones",0
"Well done. Very enjoyable and the acting was outstanding from almost everyone, 
PEOPLE WHO REVIEW 1 (Lowest ) just homeless BOTS

Well made and well played by the actors. Perfect casting. Also, the big twist at the end of the series.",1
"Full of entertainment. Every one in the series has done fantastic work.  Aryan khan has nailed it,  amazing work .",1
"The Ba*ds of Bollywood looks glossy and has some fun cameos, but the story is predictable, messy, and often drags. The satire is loud without much depth, characters lack emotional pull, and it feels more style than substance. Overall: 2/10 ‚Äî boring and forgettable.",0
Movie was great. Love every second of the movie. I was so hookedi nto the movie that i syatyed awake till 4 ro finish the whole series.,1
Every single scene is really perfect and the twist at the end was the last thing I expected. Totally would recommend watching this.,1
Loved it. Looking forward to what's next for Aryan as director. One of the best made series.,1
Didn't expect this from the new comer one and only Aryan Khan.It was beyond what I had thought. It is mind blowing and fucking awsome.üôè,0
Worst web series of all time.Zero plot. Zero acting.Zero story. Looks like a school project.Infact school projects have better screenplay than this üí©üí©üí©.Dont believe me? Have doubt? Just watch first 30 minutes.,0
Good series. I was sceptical of this but end up being bing watching the series. I'm still on episode 4 yet  compelled enough to write this review.,1
"Aryan Khan‚Äôs The Bads of Bollywood is bold and fresh. Loved the satire on the industry and the stylish direction, though some parts felt stretched. Strong debut.",1
"Aryan khan (director) - He should direct an action thriller movie...

First episode starting is just perfect 
But feels flat in some episodes

I personally didn't liked the twist (My opinion)

Overall - 3.5 rating

"1 dead fish can spoil the whole pond... similarly one mistake that spoilt the whole series.

Refreshing and entertaining except one episode where it get a bit slow but ending was super entertaining.. üòÖüôÉ loved the show!,1
"‚ÄúEvery frame screams rebellion‚ÄîAryan paints Bollywood in shades we‚Äôve never dared to see. With ‚ÄòBads of Bollywood,‚Äô he rips apart the gloss, exposes the grit and serves storytelling that‚Äôs raw, fearless and impossible to ignore. This isn‚Äôt just direction, it‚Äôs a cultural jolt""",0
Best indian webseries I had ever seen you have to go and watch the webseries it's amazing with most of all Bollywood stars I love this webseries,1
"The show is really good & there isn't moment where u will be bored , it just keeps u stick to ur screens unlike other Indian Ott's .",0
"Ba***ds of Bollywood isn‚Äôt just a series‚Äîit‚Äôs an unapologetic punch in the gut to the glitzy illusions we‚Äôre used to seeing. Raw, gritty, and brutally honest, it tears down the velvet curtains of glamour and exposes the chaos, ego, and madness that really fuel the industry.",1
"Just loved it as a comedy & ba***ds drama.....

To Aryan tremendous work..... 
If it's the talent of nepotism then i support nepotism ü§ó",1
People who‚Äôve been observing this industry over the years will find many reasons to laugh out loud. AryanKhan makes a SUPERB debut as a director.,1

Something refreshing to watch. I was tired of same old gharelu or typical gaav side gunda gardi series. Very good.,1
Too Good! Very impressive Aryan Khan. Brilliantly Fab. Defo no words master piece! Smashed it,1
"In some moments it made me thinking how they were ready to portrait the ugly truth of Bollywood!! 

Superb acting, the concept, the direction never felt it is the first project of Aryan Khan!",1
"Never admired SRK in my life.....but I am a fan of Aryan khan from now
This is the the direction india needs to set to get global recognitions

An amazing and new concept series! Love it! You did exceptionally great Mr Aryan Khan. üëå,1
The comedy is nice but it was too much when the main actor cast ‚ÄúAasman‚Äù and Karishma‚Äù who were about to get married and Karishma signed marriage papers too and then they came to know they are brother sister. Aisi story bhi nahi likhni chahiye.,1
"Yesterday night I started watching new series on Netflix, bads of Bollywood, I love the series, just love the scenes, actors,   love the series, really good job done by all the team, loveeeee it.ü§©üòç",1
A very different gutsy take on the current Bollywood and also made for the GenZ . The language may not appeal to the oldies but it is absolutely entertaining üëè,1
I just Loved the Series!!! Aryan Khan has Done 100% Justice to his Directorial Debut !!!I Shall wait to watch is Nextüëçüëçüëç,1
Shitty show...the language and the crude sense of humor is enough to put one off...this show was unable to evoke any kind of emotion in me...I don't think I smiled even once during the show..or shed a tear..or felt anything for that matter... absolutely pathetic....!!!!,0
Mostly positive reviews floating around seem to be straight from the PR team‚Äôs desk . Overall nice series but excellent and amazing marketing for a launch ....,1
"Honestly, Bads of Bollywood felt refreshing quirky, raw and different from the usual Bollywood vibe.For me, Bads of Bollywood didn‚Äôt really click. The idea was interesting, but the execution felt stretched and repetitive.",1
"I watched all the seven episodes and I was surprised that a young director and in his first attempt he achieved so much perfection, wow that was fun.",1
Some fresh Entertainment.... Awesome Direction.... Kuch naya mila dekhne ko.... Keep it up ARYAN and team.... At last.... BOBBY you rock....,1
"Completely bullshit
this is something which director have looked around till yet and now showing all the world
masturbation, illigitmate relations, using extreme abusive language infront of parents and a sacred relationship of brother and sister into...
shame on them
really, the title suits on them, Bastards.",1

I watch 3/4 of the first episodes with a bit of struggle",0
I was really excited during the whole show. The climax was awesome. Love for Aryan Khan!,1
Ppl would only watch once as it has name of SRK son. Otherwise it‚Äôs complete crap! Initial episodes seem promising but for no reason swearing is excessive! End is absolutely nonsense.,0
Easily the most entertaining shows. I don't know how any random guy have audacity to put 1 star for such an amazing show!,1
