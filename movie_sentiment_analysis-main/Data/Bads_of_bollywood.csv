I say this NO exaggeration!!! It was so refreshing, satirical, full of Easter eggs and references, ironic humour and honestly felt like a big middle finger to everyone who keeps making fun of the Bollywood industry. It felt like an ‚Äúin your face, bitches‚Äù statement by Aaryan Khan, and I LOVED it. IT IS TRUE ENTERTAINMENT!!!

Watching the show through the eyes of someone who actually grew up in the industry felt fresh and new. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect it to be as good as it genuinely turned out to be.

The performances were absolutely nailed by the cast. Lakshaye Lalwani, as always, was outstanding in his role as Aasmaan. His portrayal of an ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù actor finally getting his big break and then navigating the glamorous yet cutthroat, politically charged world of Bollywood was truly impressive. But the real highlight was the friendship between Aasmaan and Parvez (played by Raghav). Their bond felt so natural and effortless, with the kind of best friend chemistry that instantly draws you in. And Raghav‚Äôs comedic timing? Absolutely unbelievable!!!!
Sahher Bambba was amazing as Karishma Talwar, a nepo kid trying to find her way in the industry. The way her character balanced the privileges of a silver spoon with the struggles it brings was so well done. Bobby Deol, like the fine wine that he is, was a treat to watch, along with Anya Singh, Mona Singh, and Manoj Pahwa, all of whom played their characters with finesse.

Even the cameos were a delight. Big actors showing up for just a glimpse made it so much fun. It was especially nice to see Rajat Bedi (as Jaraj Saxena) back on screen after forever; I last remember him from Koi Mil Gaya and nowhere after that!

Despite the many characters and subplots, the pacing was tight and engaging. The show had hilarious moments, brainrot worthy bits, slick action sequences, and even car chases. The dialogues, songs, and background score were top notch too.

And that plot twist in the last episode, OH. MY. GOD. The twists were twisting in ways I didn‚Äôt see coming, and the ending was just such an unexpected yet brilliant way to close things off.

Overall, Ba****ds of Bollywood is a solid A. It‚Äôs fun, refreshing, well made, and absolutely worth your time. If you‚Äôve always loved Bollywood, this one‚Äôs for you. Aaryan Khan truly SERVED US with this one!!!","You and 120 other people found this helpful.","120 people found this helpful."

I enjoyed every bit of it from start to finish. The storyline was engaging, the characters were well-written, and the emotional depth really hit home.

Imran Hashmi‚Äôs entry was simply awesome. His presence brought a whole new energy to the show and he nailed every scene he was in. Raghav Juyal‚Äôs performance was another standout. I was honestly blown away by how good he was. His acting felt so real and intense, it added a lot of weight to the story.

I also want to appreciate all the actors who brought their characters to life so well. Each one added something unique to the story, making the series even more captivating.

The climax was something else. The twist about the main character falling in love with his stepsister was bold and unexpected. It was handled in a way that made you feel the emotional conflict without making it uncomfortable. It added a powerful layer to the whole narrative.

What I really appreciated was how the series gave a fresh take compared to typical Bollywood reality shows. It didn‚Äôt follow the usual predictable formulas and instead brought something unique and real, which made it stand out in a sea of similar content.

From my perspective, this series truly stands out because of its bold storytelling and strong performances. The way it mixes emotional depth with unexpected twists keeps the audience fully engaged. It‚Äôs refreshing to see a show that doesn‚Äôt shy away from complex themes and delivers them with sincerity. The chemistry between the actors and the well-crafted narrative really make it memorable.

Honestly, I‚Äôm already looking forward to the second series. This story has so much potential, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next in part two. Hopefully, it comes out soon because I‚Äôm definitely ready for more!

Overall, this series was a complete package. Great performances, strong writing, and a storyline that keeps you thinking even after it ends. I‚Äôm really glad I watched it and would definitely recommend it to others.","You and 50 other people found this helpful.","50 people found this helpful."

I absolutely loved the series. It was so entertaining! The first few epis were hilarious and genuinely funny. There are also clever hints that seem to point directly at certain people (you know who).

Regarding the cast, from the main characters to the supporting characters, everyone did a fantastic job. I especially enjoyed Raghav Juyal‚Äôs comic moments. He really showed how versatile he is as an actor. His pairing with Lakshya Lalwani was perfect, like two peas in a pod. Both of them were brilliant, and the same goes for the rest of the cast, from leads to supporting roles. Senior actors like Bobby Deol and Manoj Pahwa were brilliant too.

The biggest highlight for me was the cameos. They were awesome. None of them felt forced or unnecessary. I also felt the series leaned into dark comedy at times, which was refreshing. Plus, it revealed certain behind-the-scenes truths about the movie industry that audiences rarely get to see. I only wish they had carried that thread through till the end.

Story-wise, it‚Äôs not perfect, but it honestly exceeded my expectations. I didn‚Äôt expect something this good from Aryan and his team. As a newcomer, he really nailed how to make people laugh (which is funny, since he rarely shows it on his own face). The dialogues were another highlight; sharp, witty, and hilarious.

Overall, this series is a must-watch for me. I‚Äôm definitely going to rewatch it, because I love to laugh, and it‚Äôs rare for a Hindi show to make me laugh this much, without feeling forced or overdone.","You and 106 other people found this helpful.","106 people found this helpful."

A young director creating something like this is so impressive. I‚Äôm still laughing while writing this review. The way he handled some real issues of Bollywood in a comic way was just brilliant ‚Äî like that drug raid üòÇ officer scene, man! And in such a fun way, he also raised the point about how outsiders are treated in Bollywood. You can think of doing things your own way, but you can‚Äôt actually do it your way, because Bollywood looks glamorous from the outside but is too dark from the inside.

The cinematography was good, and of course, the colouring was done by Red Chillies Entertainment, so no doubt it was brilliant. The songs may not be all-time chartbuster type, but they were well used in the series. The screenplay was excellent üëå, and there‚Äôs an unexpected twist in the story that will leave you in shock and completely change the whole plot.

There are cameos of so many Bollywood stars ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to give spoilers, but trust me, one cameo will blow your mind! And the actors have all given their best. Every single one of them was outstanding. But if I have to give a shoutout to someone, it would be Raghav Juyal and Manoj Pahwa sir and Manish Chaudhary as Freddy.

Point to be noted ‚Äî Karan Johar didn‚Äôt just make a cameo appearance; he is in the full series, and his role was very important! The lead actor Lakshya was outstanding, man. Sahher Bambba is the new crush of B-Town, and Anya Singh as the manager was just WOW! The way Bobby Deol sir was represented in this series will remind you of the young Bobby Deol, and Mona ma‚Äôam, as always, was the cherry on the cake.

So overall, it was a highly entertaining web series that showcased the dark side of Bollywood in a comic way.

Created and directed by Aryan Khan, this series is a fearless and hilarious look at the glitzy yet often absurd world of movies, with a razor-sharp script that consistently delivers on its promise of an inside-out expos√©. It's a show that will not only entertain avid Bollywood fans but also offer a compelling and insightful peek for those unfamiliar with the industry's inner workings.
From the very first episode, the series establishes a tone that is both goofy and deeply self-aware. It masterfully uses humor to tackle serious subjects, including nepotism, star-power, and the constant media scrutiny that plagues the industry. The writing is the show's biggest strength, filled with clever Easter eggs, witty dialogues, and moments of self-deprecating humor that are a joy to witness. It's a tight and well-paced narrative that never loses its footing.
The casting is an absolute triumph. While the star-studded cameos are a delightful surprise and add to the show's meta-humor, it is the core cast that truly makes the series shine. The lead performances are nothing short of brilliant, bringing authenticity and heart to their characters. They are perfectly cast for their roles, and their chemistry is palpable, making their journey‚Äîfrom ambitious newcomers to navigating industry chaos‚Äîfeel incredibly real and relatable.
Technically, the show is a visual treat. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the glamour of showbiz while also using a unique visual style to enhance the storytelling. The music is equally outstanding, adding layers to the scenes and serving as a crucial part of the narrative.
What sets ""The Ba***ds of Bollywood"" apart is its courage to mock itself and its world. It is a bold, confident, and unapologetically entertaining series that proves a well-written script, strong direction, and excellent performances can create a true masterpiece. It is, without a doubt, one of the best shows of the year and a must-watch on Netflix.","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (4/5)

I hope there is no spoilers in this review 

The B**ds of Bollywood is a lively comedy-drama that captures the chaos, humor, and emotions of the film industry with wit and heart.

The cast shines brightly: Bobby Deol commands attention with his seasoned presence, Lakshya adds sincerity and freshness, and Mona as Lakshya‚Äôs mother delivers such warmth and depth that you will definitely remember her performance. Manoj Pahwa once again proves why he‚Äôs one of the finest character actors, bringing effortless comedy. And of course, Raghav Juyel is the true scene-stealer ‚Äî his quirky style, natural humor, and charisma make him unforgettable.

Credit also goes to director Aryan Khan, who makes a fantastic debut. His direction is stylish, confident, and surprisingly mature for a first film, marking him as one of the most promising debutant directors in Bollywood.

The story keeps you entertained with its blend of laughs and emotions, and the climax is staged on such a grand scale that it will ‚Äî at least once ‚Äî remind you of Game of Thrones, though with a lighter, more playful touch.

Overall, The B**ds of Bollywood is a smart, entertaining 4/5 watch ‚Äî powered by strong performances and Aryan Khan‚Äôs impressive directorial debut.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

What I loved the most is honesty ~ raw & brutal, and the multi-zillion inspirations taken from a longggggg list of industry realities. Creativity truly taken a different turn with this series. Every fiction stems from some contextual facts and this series is an ode to that. I love how so, so, so, so many little incidents, situations, experiences from an array of bollywood lives have been weaved so meticulously. I felt this series to be a perfect amalgamation of Madhur Bhandarkar & Farah Khan (') taste of direction and story writing. Fully Indian masala, truth embedded and sewed in entertainment.  One blank that I felt in the role played by Bobby Deol - it could have been portrayed in a different light solely because this gentleman is a superb actor and has proved his mettal and might in both Ashram & Animal - hence showcasing him as the bad man is something that has been already massively seen so that is one place which I feel could be something different; or, if one could portray them in a much evilier form which I am sure bollywood in reality has. This was like Bobby's upped game in villainous roles was much much milder here. If there ever comes a season 2 then definitely his role needs to shine atop as the most villainous else it would be a bad usage of his talent. 
Another flaw was the way both Asmaan & Karishma met at the end in the coffee shop - this scene seemed to be in a rush and there was no actual emotional angel to it, but definitely the last line by the actor, ""Rakhi pe milenge"" was funny but not hahah hillarious.
Loved how every *special appearance* actor in their 10 to 30 seconders were put in various places. I maybe wrong, but I felt a lot of emotional struggle stories were taken as is from Siddhant Chaturvedi, Shanaya Kapoor and Ananya Pandey's real life spaces. Except the last ~ episode 7, other episodes were normally portrayed which also showed a lot of underlinning simplicity under so so so so much glamour. Few thing, I still am curious about is
Q ""Why Ajay's son so against his whole familiar?"" 
Q ""Why did Gautami made the statement, 'there is a difference between being in love and being married'!""
That is a mystery; I mean one can assume a lot of reason, but it would be fun to see the 'whys' if there is a season 2. And at the end of all this ~ I super liked how even with so much glamour, big stars, et al; the humane emotions kept flowing in every scene, in between the dialogues, it felt real and genuinely very middle class; funnily even when they show the families in such huge mansions; retaining that at the end of the day, everyone is a normal person - even the actors. Certainly everyone, every single actor has done a brilliant job of showcasing their craft and talent of *ACTING* - this credit surely goes to the Director hands down. One of the raremost until now where the series outbid its promotions; specifically in today's world where promotions show a lot of promise and then the actual product is absolute blah. Congratulations and all the best to each and every person who gave their bit to this series. 
For me the rating is somewhere between 3 & 4 however I did not have the option of rating something in between.

Episodes 1‚Äì3:
The opening episodes are highly engaging, filled with sharp humor, clever dialogues, and strong character introductions. Raghav Juyal and Lakshya Lalwani share fantastic on-screen chemistry, bringing comic relief and energy to every scene. The satire on Bollywood‚Äôs inner workings keeps things light yet intriguing.

Episode 6:
This episode takes a bold turn, exploring complex and often messy relationships. It crosses certain emotional and moral lines, keeping viewers glued to the screen as the story delves into darker, more complicated themes.

Climax (Episode 7):
The final episode delivers an unpredictable twist, blending comedy with drama and leaving viewers surprised till the very end. It ties together the humor, relationships, and mystery in a satisfying way, though some might feel it could have gone even deeper with the behind-the-scenes revelations.


Performances:
The cast shines throughout, with standout performances from Raghav Juyal, Lakshya Lalwani, Bobby Deol, and Manoj Pahwa. Cameos are a delightful surprise, never feeling forced or unnecessary.

Verdict:

The chemistry and timing between them were impressive. I liked Vijayant Kohli's portrayal of dad, reminiscent of Farooq Shaikh's character from YJHD. Mona Singh was also excellent as the mom with witty comebacks. Anya Singh's character, Sanya, was a highlight among all the characters in the movie, and she played it to perfection. 

Then comes the veterans - Bobby Deol, Manoj Pahwa and Manish Chaudhari. They took the series to a whole new level, subtly exposing the facade behind the glam of the film industry. Rajat bedi (use kahin toh dekha hai :-) ) 

Aryan Khan, the director, is definitely someone to watch out for. He has skillfully used his star kid status to his advantage, rather than relying on it. Celebrity cameos, we have seen many a times in other films and movies but the way he has woven them as a part of narrative is truly seamless.

From the very first episode, I was hooked by its chaotic energy and clever digs at real-life scandals. The cameos are insane‚Äîevery few minutes a superstar walks in, and yet it never feels forced.

The Ba*ds of Bollywood has been a buzz-worthy project, largely due to its director, Aryan Khan. The series is a mixed bag, offering some entertaining moments but also falling into familiar and ""seen-before"" tropes of the film industry.
What Works:
 * Meta Humor and Tributes: The series is filled with self-referential jokes and ""meta humor"" that seem to be a hit with audiences, particularly Gen Z. It includes nods to iconic moments from Shah Rukh Khan's career and makes fun of the industry's stereotypes.
 * Cameos: High-profile cameos from stars like Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and others are a major draw. Shah Rukh's appearance is particularly noted as a highlight.
 * Performances: The supporting cast, including Manoj Pahwa and Mona Singh, have been praised for their performances. Bobby Deol's role has also been a pleasant surprise for many viewers.
 * Insider's Perspective: The series attempts to give an inside look at the Bollywood industry, addressing topics like nepotism, the ""movie mafia,"" and the pressures of fame.
What Doesn't Work:
 * Tonal Confusion: Some critics point out a confusion in the series' tone. It's unclear whether it's genuinely satirizing the industry or simply using stereotypes to tell a predictable story.
 * Predictable Plot: The story is stretched out over seven episodes and often feels like a collection of cliches. Many feel it could have been a much tighter film. The main narrative lacks a compelling arc and can be tedious to watch at times.
 * Over-reliance on Cameos: While the cameos are a highlight, some argue that the series heavily relies on them and other self-digs to compensate for a weak script and uninspired storytelling.
 * Weak Writing: The screenplay is often criticized for being sluggish, with dialogues that are not always effective. The humor, while appreciated by some, is seen as dated and not ""self-aware"" enough by others.
Overall:
The Ba*ds of Bollywood is a series that aims for a sharp, satirical take on the Hindi film industry. While it succeeds in parts, particularly with its insider jokes and high-profile cameos, it often falls short due to a weak, overstretched plot and a lack of a clear, coherent vision. It's the kind of show that will likely appeal to fans who enjoy ""brain rot"" cinema‚Äîa term used by some to describe content that is nonsensical but fun to watch due to its outrageous and illogical nature. If you're looking for a serious, well-crafted drama, this might not be it, but if you're in the mood for a fun, over-the-top ride with plenty of insider references, it might be worth a watch.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

We expect Red Chillies Entertainment to bring us a top product and they had delivered as always. From the very begining to the very end, all actors have performed their heat out with ease. Most of them are experienced actors and they live upto their reputations. And the newcomers also shine bright. Debutant writer/director Aryan has done very good job along with his fellow creatives to bring a banger. The special effects department has done amazing job. Especially in the opening montage when , Aasmaan does his stunt and is mid-way through air. That was flexing of their abilities to do VFX and rightfully so. Kudos to editors for apt cuts and saving audience's time. All music pieces hit the heart well and fine. And the cameos are like cherry on the cake. Now the question is, if this series gets another season, who we can expect next to appear? But before that let's hope for a second season. Especially because now we know the well kept secret and wants to know more about what happens with our hero and his gang.

Being an SRKIAN, have seen Aryan growing and with his directorial debut, he presented an awesome creation which has all the masala of bollywood films.
A struggling actor got a chance in a big banner film and his journey to establish himself in the industry, and if you think this is the one liner, oh God, you are mistaken.
This story has a wonderful twist at the end which would make you feel awestruck.
The ensemble cast of the series was absolutely in tone with their respective characters.
Lakshya and Sahher looked glamorous yet tender. Manoj Pahwa and Mona Singh seemed to be perfect choice. Raghav Juyal was absolutely magnificent with his timing of delivery. Anya Singh, Rajat Bedi(seen him after long time), Manish Choudhary (with typical stylish negativity) had justice to their characters.
Though the quick relationship between the hero and heroine and their understanding, I felt, could have been portrayed with bit patience. The typical illogicality of Masala movies(Thank God), is almost absent in the series.
And yes Bobby Deol, was flawlessly acted with an undertone and won my üíú heart.
KJ acted as KJ and with his inimitable style and smartness. Arshad Warsi as Gafoor Bhai acted as per his standards.

Aryan, you have created a popular and wonderful series where audience will definitely enjoy thoroughly, you brilliantly weaved nepotism vs outsider issue. You smartky mocked over the drug police (NCB or whatever) and presented a wonderful and feel good series for us.

Ohh didn't I write a word about SRK?
Nothing to write Badshah, your presence in the screen makes the day of billions. Love you always...Loved to watch SS Rajamouli, Aamir Khan, Ranbir Singh, Ranbir Kapoor and ofcourse Tamalli Maya Eemran Hashmi in and as themselves.

The series follows an aspiring actor and his friends as they navigate the industry's glamorous facade and its murky underbelly.

The show's main strength is its self-awareness and insider humor. It's filled with meta-references and celebrity cameos, including appearances from Shah Rukh Khan, Karan Johar, and Ranbir Kapoor, which add a layer of authenticity and fun. The series takes playful jabs at everything from nepotism debates to media scrutiny, often recreating viral moments from real life for a knowing audience. For those who follow Bollywood closely, these references are a major highlight and a source of genuine laughter.

However, this insider approach is also its biggest weakness. For viewers not steeped in Bollywood gossip and culture, many of the jokes and nuances might fall flat. The narrative can feel disjointed and, at times, struggles to find its footing between sharp satire and a more conventional, dramatic storyline. While some critics have lauded the show as a fresh and bold debut, others have found it to be a mixed bag, relying too heavily on its meta-commentary rather than a compelling, standalone plot.

Ultimately, ""The Bads of Bollywood"" is a project clearly made by someone who knows the industry inside and out. It's a show that will likely be a treat for die-hard Bollywood fans who appreciate the self-deprecating humor and clever nods, but it may not resonate as strongly with a wider, more general audience.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

The Indian entertainment industry has witnessed a significant shift in recent years, with the emergence of web series as a popular form of content consumption. Bollywood, in particular, has seen a surge in web series production, offering a fresh platform for creators to showcase their talent and experiment with new stories.

The web series format has provided a unique opportunity for writers, directors, and actors to push boundaries and explore complex themes that may not be feasible in traditional film or television formats. With the freedom to experiment and take risks, web series have become a breeding ground for innovative storytelling and character-driven narratives.

One of the key advantages of web series is their ability to cater to niche audiences and explore specific genres or themes that may not appeal to a broad audience.

From episode to episode, the show maintains a flow that keeps you invested, making it remarkably easy to binge.

What‚Äôs particularly compelling is the way the series weaves in the ever-present conversation around nepotism, offering a fleeting but honest glimpse behind the glossy fa√ßade of the film industry‚Äîwhether on the silver screen or its digital counterpart. Rather than presenting itself as high art, the series embraces cinema‚Äôs primary role: to entertain. Judging by the popularity it has garnered, it‚Äôs safe to say it succeeded.

Some detractors have accused the production of inflating its ratings through aggressive PR. To me, such criticism feels less like objective analysis and more like an attempt to drag down a project that has clearly resonated with audiences. Anyone familiar with the realities of film and series production knows that success isn‚Äôt just about artistic vision‚Äîit also hinges on marketability and return on investment. This series demonstrates strength on both fronts.

As for the naysayers, one wonders whether they could create something of this scale themselves.

And even the unnecessary scenes ‚Äì the ones that didn‚Äôt really push the story forward ‚Äì are still written and executed in a way that keeps you hooked. The ending, though? Totally unexpected.

Overall, I‚Äôd say this series is fun. Not a paid or biased review ‚Äì genuinely, while watching, you‚Äôll always find some scene, dialogue, or actor that entertains you.

Each episode was the perfect length, and hit all the plot points it wanted to cover, but I do think the first few episodes could've been tighter with its pacing. The script and dialogues were a bit clunky and on the nose at times, but overall the show delivered what it wanted to. I do think it relied heavily on being self satirical and meta, along with the very many cameos. The last three episodes make the show worth it for me, the payoff is brilliant! The acting is also honestly good, which is refreshing, both the newcomers and the seasoned actors deliver a good performance. It glorifies the same industry that it set out to criticize, which could be a commentary on what we do and want as an audience. The commercial aspect of it was quite fun, and it's definitely a new sort of show for the general masala bollywood audience. The swearing felt a bit much, almost like trying to carve out an edgier niche. Not the most revolutionary show or idea, but hitting enough to deliver a nice directorial debut. It will be interesting to see what Aryan Khan does next, without plot points centering around mostly referential material. The actors definitely have a bright future ahead. An entertaining watch for sure!","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

It's always disappointing when a film arrives with massive hype, only to crash and burn under the weight of its own mediocrity. This latest release, directed by none other than Shah Rukh Khan's son, is unfortunately a textbook example of style over substance‚Äîand worse, privilege over talent.

Let‚Äôs get the obvious out of the way: the only positive reviews floating around seem to be straight from the PR team‚Äôs desk. One has to wonder how many lakhs were spent polishing what is essentially a painfully dull and directionless project. For the regular audience, the truth is clear‚Äîthis is less of a cinematic experience and more of a carefully packaged launch vehicle for a star kid who got a platform, not because of merit, but because of a powerful last name.

The acting? Stiff, lifeless, and forgettable. It felt like watching a school play with a big budget. Not one performance stood out for the right reasons. Emotional scenes lacked any real depth, and the chemistry between characters was non-existent. The leads appeared more focused on their camera angles than connecting with the audience.

As for the direction‚ÄîSRK‚Äôs son may have grown up around film sets, but that exposure clearly didn‚Äôt translate into skill. The film is clunky, unevenly paced, and tonally confused. Basic storytelling elements like character development, tension-building, and narrative cohesion are all either missing or poorly executed. There‚Äôs no vision, no voice‚Äîjust a lot of borrowed aesthetics.

Overall, it feels like an expensive demo reel rather than a real film. Sure, it might grab some headlines because of the last names involved, but it won‚Äôt be remembered for its craft. For viewers expecting quality cinema, this is a hard pass.

Save your money, save your time. Let the PR machinery do what it does, but don‚Äôt fall for the hype.","You and 72 other people found this helpful.","72 people found this helpful."

The Bads of Bollywood is not only badly named‚Äîit‚Äôs prophetic, because bad is the most generous word you can use for this cinematic catastrophe.

The direction feels like a confused college project masquerading as a film. Scenes drag on endlessly with no sense of rhythm or purpose, dialogue is delivered with all the passion of a robot learning Hindi, and the story‚Äîif you can even call this collection of clich√©s a story‚Äîwanders like a drunk tourist lost in Mumbai traffic.

Khan‚Äôs attempt at ‚Äúedgy filmmaking‚Äù results in nothing more than incoherent montages, awkward silences, and camera angles that suggest the cinematographer either fell asleep or tripped over the tripod. Every character is a cardboard cutout, every emotional beat is telegraphed a mile away, and yet somehow the film still manages to surprise you‚Äîbecause you‚Äôre constantly shocked that it keeps getting worse.

And then there‚Äôs the language. The show shamelessly throws in abusive words at every possible moment‚Äînot because the plot demands it, not because it adds realism, but simply as a cheap trick to grab attention and court controversy. It‚Äôs desperation disguised as dialogue, and it makes the whole thing feel even more hollow.

The random entries of fake Bollywood stars were not only unnecessary, they were distracting and laughable. The only glimmer of talent came from Mona Singh and the elder Yajobi, whose performances showed what real experience looks like‚Äîbut even their efforts are wasted here, buried under the weight of this mess. And of course, the film doesn‚Äôt even bother to give them the respect or space they deserve.

By the end, you‚Äôre not just bored‚Äîyou‚Äôre offended. Offended that your time, your money, and your sanity were sacrificed for this vanity project. The Bads of Bollywood doesn‚Äôt just dishonor cinema; it makes you wonder if Aryan Khan secretly hates audiences.

For the first 10 minutes I thought this was going to be a cringe fest, but it took a turn for the better. Soon, it became entertaining. 
The concept is a mix of a lot of things. Towards the end you'll think, ""yeh toh kahi dekha hai"", and you're right if you have watched some of the prominent movies of that genre. 
The actors have all done a wonderful job. The dialogues aren't cringe, and neither is the acting. A lot of emotions and a lot of genuine acting.

The story is routine except for a twist in the end that lovers are brother and sister from an illegal relationship. That was the most shit part of this WS. Probably it is first time that story ends in this way in Indian filmdom.

The WS is abundant with abuses. No holds barred- they abuse before parents, siblings, and all. Loud rap music. Useless fights. 

The lead Lakshya bursts into fight, here and there, which is very filmy, even on sets. Likewise  Boby Deol is acting as a superhero and always shown with a wine glass and cigarette in hands. Nothing new to show a villainous character. Many cameos but none memorable. It is a below average WS. 

What is the message out of this WS??- whether it is a love story or revenge drama or patriotic or sports or what??

The expletives/ abuses are plenty these days in movies/ WS released on OTT. But in this WS (BoB) they crossed all limits - all of them are hurling very filthy abuses in front of all.  May be the SRK and his family is accustomed to all this but I think still 99% of our population abstain from doing this, at least before someone whom you respect and especially ladies.

The simple funda is that when you like a movie/WS you may watch it again and again. But for this WS(BoB) you will repent that why you watched it?

The star ratings given till date seems to be paid and PR work like awards. 

Of casts i only liked Mona Singh and Manish Chaudhri.

Minus(-1)/5 stars. 

There should be (-) negative stars facility.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

Overall storyline could have been crisper, with a different unpredictable ending. Perhaps reserved for a Sequel!  A feedback is to have the language  toned down for covering younger audience.

Raghav's quirky character and timing, especially in the scene where he sang 'Kaho Na Kaho' with Emraan Hashmi, stood out.

If I want to put this series in simple words, it's a typical bollywood with a modern masala. 
Now coming to the actor They done a GREAT job , all the supporting characters were amazing the comic timing was bang on . A special shoutout to Raghav. The rumour is witty with some bollywood style dialogue that didn't felt cringe . The chemos of I should say of whole bollywood doesn't disappoint. Another shoutout to The Karan Johar loved his bollywood mafia style.
All in all it's a good watch . Good entertainment, with laughter and emotions and drama.

Yes, there are instances where goosebumps do take the place, the story do make one count upon it and the
actors like Raghav and Bobby
Deol have definitely made their
charm upon us. The very concept of
parody for the various Bollywood
concepts, the hidden realities
and the very sarcastic tone do stand tight on scale. Special mentions to Raghav and Bobby Deol ji. These have left the impacts, for sure.

Yet on an overall set, the whole show is a blatant failure for Aryan Khan as a
directorial debut as well as for all such
big big stars from SS Rajamouli
to 3 Khans.And the very the lumpous Laksh's acting was definitely not at all
appeasing. The whole
Bollywoodisation (2000s bollywood style of romanticissation of the story
is very disheartening to see. The story which was looking promising in the very beginning just ended up in same old school of same eloping the girl and getting into a marriage and fighting
with the girl's father, etc. 

The abuses in conversations, except for Raghav-Lakshay ones, were total inorganic and unnecessary especially those Manoj Baba ones.

The story got lost in between which suddenly got inspired from 90s movies.

Even family people are cursing all the time in front of younger generation. No decency at all! I have never heard so much of curse words in my whole life what was spoken in a few episodes of this show. Why did the producers and seniors actors let that happen? Do they really talk like that in their homes?? Are they scared, desperate or too apologetic to their own children for whatever reasons? Disgusting, obscene, disappointing with so many flaws ... hero doesn't have a cell phone for weeks, mother informs the son when father is going into operation theatre for his liver transplant, hero's best friend keeps getting them all into trouble, ruining his friend's career and justifying it saying ,"" he does these stupidity because he thinks from his heart. On top of that hero is so dumb, he thinks response to every set back is violence, a flash back of his dad's dialogue makes him do violent crimes. Wow! Way too away from the reality. This is what happens when  hurt and angry kids with no real life experiences from protected families get into their debut adventure of DIRECTING. Bad dialogues, unbelievable situations, delusional characters and of course very bad language blahh. Is everybody in the bollywood really that manipulative, crude, mean, sad and with no moral values?

With his first one he for sure had a lot of support from all the celebrity special appearances which kept us glued. I like imaigining what the show could have been without them. First scene just after premier when Aasman is out of his screening, is this how even a first timer gets into the streets? Haha I felt as if the actor is watching a dream and he will open his eyes to see his dreams shattered. It was off. Bobby Deol and his scenes had lot of grip. Even Aasman had lot of grip. Direction was not great. Lot of spices in many diff ways added in the show so lacked the depth, but great that Aryan might have got a glimpse that which spice suits his genre the best and he will be able to direct it.

At best, Raghav manages to give you a chuckle here and there, but beyond that the so-called ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù is nothing more than cheap, foul-mouthed nonsense. And the worst part? It‚Äôs all being glorified in the name of ‚Äúcoolness.‚Äù

SRK‚Äôs PR team never misses a chance to paint Aryan Khan as some ultra-sanskaari saint. Well, if you want to truly understand his values, just watch this show. It perfectly reflects the mentality behind it, normalized disrespect towards parents, degrading jokes about one‚Äôs own sister, and a shallow portrayal of privilege disguised as entertainment. If this is what Bollywood calls ‚Äúedgy,‚Äù then God help us.

And let‚Äôs be honest, the only way this show is going to survive is through a tsunami of paid PR. Very soon your Instagram feed will be flooded with posts screaming about ‚Äúthe best debut of Aryan Khan.‚Äù Take my advice: it‚Äôs fucking not. Don‚Äôt fall for the propaganda.

The double standards you'll watch in this show, it‚Äôs like the show wants to roast Bollywood but ends up glamorizing the same toxic traits it pretends to critique. Basically, satire without teeth.

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the songs and background score, they‚Äôre like rubbing salt on an already festering wound.

To be blunt, Mr. Khan needs to accept the fact that none of his ‚Äúnepo products‚Äù are cut out for the entertainment industry. And honestly, the show should be rebranded from Bads of Bollywood to Tatti of Bollywood, because that‚Äôs exactly what it is, pure, unfiltered TATTI.","You and 36 other people found this helpful.","36 people found this helpful."

This series had me on a rollercoaster. At first I was hooked. The first few episodes I really enjoyed.

Suddenly everything made sense. The title the buildup the chaos it all clicked. That one episode single handedly dragged the whole series out of mediocrity and into brilliance. The twist was not just good it was pure chef‚Äôs kiss good.

Also full credit to Aryan Khan. The man might as well have a PhD in Marketing Wizardry. He knew exactly what he was doing. The way he promoted the show was so creative and unique. Even the title itself was like a puzzle hiding clues until the story revealed the big twist. That is genuine marketing genius.

Nothing new and same old predictable story. Each Bollywood real character had a glorified entry irrespective whether the script required it or not. I had to FF half of the episodes. Just a weak characterisation. Acting was average. Dialogues needed to be more naturally flowing into the storyline. More hype than substance

And the sets and costumes looked so artificial. Everything looked too much polished. No authenticity at all. A great show should have great authentic feeling. Not sure if Aryan Khan watches good Hindi shows to learn from‚Ä¶. See panchayat, pataallok etc.

He has translated his Bollywood world around him from one side view only. You need to have experience in life to infuse soul into your creation. Sadly the soul was missing completely from the show.

Aryan should go on a road trip for a year to experience real life. People around him will  praise his work a lot but that is because of being the biggest nepo kid around and not because of his work.

This is evident when you are ridiculing Wankhade in the opening scene. This is abuse of your privilege and you will never blossom in your own. You are not cool when you are using the F* word all around‚Ä¶ thst does not make the show superb. It does not resonate with the audience.

The narrative feels shallow, often brushing over complex histories, personalities, and cultural nuances that could have added meaningful layers. Instead of presenting thoughtful explorations, the series seems content with surface-level dramatization.

Another major drawback is the excessive use of indecent, vulgar, and unspeakable language. While one could argue that such language mirrors the raw realities of the industry‚Äôs underbelly, its overuse feels unnecessary and, at times, forced. Rather than enhancing authenticity, it distracts from the story and risks alienating viewers who are looking for substance rather than sensationalism.

Overall, Bad**s of Bollywood misses an opportunity. With such rich and controversial subject matter at its disposal, it could have offered a bold, insightful, and thought-provoking narrative. Instead, it leans too heavily on profanity and shock, leaving viewers with a series that feels more exploitative than illuminating.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

From the first frame to the last, it feels like you‚Äôre watching someone test how much nonsense an audience can endure before walking out. Spoiler: it‚Äôs a lot, but not enough to survive this.

The direction is chaotic, like Khan threw ideas at the wall and filmed whatever slid down. Scenes stretch with no urgency, no flow, just dead air. The dialogue has all the warmth and energy of a voicemail, and the ‚Äúplot‚Äù is less a story than a pile of clich√©s duct-taped together.

Visually, it‚Äôs even worse. Shots cut together with no rhythm, silences drag like awkward family dinners, and the camera seems lost‚Äîlike even it wants to escape. The characters? Empty shells. Their ‚Äúemotions‚Äù are so forced you can predict the reaction before the line is spoken, yet the film still manages to surprise you by continuously lowering the bar.

Then comes the language. Every other line is littered with abuses, not to serve the narrative, but to shout, look how bold we are! It‚Äôs not bold‚Äîit‚Äôs lazy. It‚Äôs the cinematic version of a teenager scribbling swear words on a desk and calling it rebellion.

Cameos from fake Bollywood stars? Unnecessary, distracting, and unintentionally hilarious. The only flickers of actual performance come from Mona Singh and the elder Yajobi, but even they can‚Äôt rescue this shipwreck‚Äîthey‚Äôre background furniture in a room that‚Äôs already on fire.

By the end, you‚Äôre not just done with the film‚Äîyou‚Äôre done with the idea of giving Aryan Khan another chance. The Bads of Bollywood isn‚Äôt just bad art; it‚Äôs anti-art. It mocks your time, your patience, and your intelligence.

The parallels, the completing the circle, the Easter eggs, the plot twists, the references, the irony. Everything! 

The best part of it all? Aryan khan.

He had the access to the resources and he freakin used it right! Loved everything about it. 

And then there's the title. Boy oh boy. You absolute genius. Hiding the ""star"" in the name so clearly, my gosh!

It's Bollywood's version of Entourage, with a strong dose of action sprinkled toward the third act. Aryan is competent with keeping the drama moving and presenting spectacle, but the comedy in the show is the real star. The laughs have a nostalgic nineties feel in the best possible way. Yes, it is partly a cameo fest, but each celeb adds weight and a fun wrinkle to the series. Definitely worth your time!

The VFX and thrills are worth their mettle. The special appearances add that excitement, by the end of it this looks a little overdone and forced. It starts pretty much on the face of it that big wigs are constantly making appearances, just out of their camaraderie and respect for Shah Rukh and Gauri.
The script totally falls flat and there are too many missess. It's as though the makers kept suffering partial memory loss throughout. For example: there is a whole episode dedicated to Jaraj and Avtar sticking a friendship, and there is a follow up to it when Avtar calls Jaraj to join them as a friend. Where Jaraj even says he has news to share about Aasmaan. But suddenly happens to see Aasmaan's kidnapping by Gafoor's men and his intentions and loyalties change track, without much of an explanation.
Then again: the whole Gafoor track seems to have gaps, it's brought in and out of the story in a very uncohessive and arbitrary way. It's as though the makers keep remembering and then keep forgetting him.
Sameer seems to disappear almost suddenly as if he was never part of the story.
All in all even if it's seen as a masala entertainer, it doesn't do justice to that genre, as every track feels incomplete and erratic.
It's odd that Shah Rukh who would have the best script writers and editors at his disposal would end up doing such shoddy work.
The VFX is a good wrapping paper around this very unthoughtful gift for the audience.
Whoever is giving this one 5 stars or is saying great things about this show, is clearly a paid reviewer.
I mean a brilliant film like Rocky Aur Rani ki Prem Kahani has 6.5 on IMDb. But this show gets 7.8, it's absolutely unthinkable and has to be rigged!","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

The characters are well-written, the story is good and most importantly the satire fits the show very well. Cast was good, Aasman's character felt a bit boring or too bold to survive.

And some vulgar & crude jokes and scenes, which add nothing to the story. It would be even more watchable, if they are edited out. Deleting a star for that !","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

What could have been an engaging story is instead a cringeworthy barrage of profanity.
The swearing in this series is not used to enhance character or plot; it feels completely gratuitous, like the writers simply didn't have the talent to create compelling dialogue without resorting to every swear word in the book. It's shocking how often the characters use the ""f"" word‚Äîto the point where it becomes unbearable and just plain tedious.

The jokes were forced and fell flat. Even Raghav, who is usually quite funny, failed to impress due to poorly written scenes and dialogues. 

So many cameos and not one seemed to impress. Of course it's hyped due to sarukh miya's pr but both the siblings are prime examples of how nepotism is ruining bollywood we once loved wholeheartedly.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."
