I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating.

Based on Mario Puzo’s bestselling novel, the movie seamlessly blends crime drama with an epic exploration of power, loyalty, and family. Every frame is a testament to Coppola’s brilliance, as he transforms a gripping tale into a timeless work of art.

At the center of this monumental film is Marlon Brando’s unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone. Brando masterfully embodies the aging patriarch with an aura of quiet menace and profound wisdom, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, evolving from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader in a chilling, yet utterly believable transformation. James Caan as the fiery Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen also shine, each adding complexity and depth to their roles.

Coppola’s direction is nothing short of visionary. His ability to craft an intricate narrative while maintaining a deliberate pace allows the characters and themes to breathe. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, often referred to as the “Prince of Darkness,” enhances the film’s iconic look, using shadows and warm tones to convey a sense of both intimacy and foreboding. Nino Rota’s haunting score, particularly the famous Godfather Waltz, further elevates the film into legend.

A fun fact: The studio initially resisted casting Marlon Brando, who was considered difficult to work with at the time. Coppola had to fight for him and famously convinced the studio by showing a test reel of Brando stuffing his cheeks with cotton balls to transform into the iconic Don Vito Corleone. The rest, as they say, is history.

The Godfather isn’t just a movie—it’s an experience. It’s a study of power and morality, a family saga, and a crime thriller all rolled into one. Its influence on filmmaking is immeasurable, and its performances, direction, and storytelling remain unparalleled. This is a film that stands the test of time, and for good reason: it’s a masterpiece in every sense of the word.","You and 28 other people found this helpful.","28 people found this helpful."

I’m giving it 5 out of 5 stars because it’s not just a movie—it’s a towering achievement in storytelling, character development, and filmmaking. From the very first scene, I was pulled into a world of power, loyalty, and quiet menace that felt incredibly real and immersive.

Marlon Brando’s performance as Don Vito Corleone was mesmerizing—calm, commanding, and unforgettable. Every word he spoke carried weight. And watching Al Pacino’s transformation from Michael the quiet outsider to the cold, calculating heir to the family legacy was absolutely masterful. That arc was one of the most compelling I’ve ever seen on screen.

What I admire most is how The Godfather balances its brutality with moments of deep, haunting beauty. It doesn’t glorify violence—it shows its cost, especially on family and morality. The cinematography, the haunting score, the unforgettable quotes—it all works together so seamlessly. The Godfather isn’t just a classic; it’s essential cinema. A masterpiece that earns every bit of its legendary status.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

""The Godfather"" reminds us that great movies are possible, but that masterpieces almost have to happen by accident.

Coppola and the in-fighting with Paramount, it's amazing the film was finished. It's amazing the powers that be didn't shut it down.
Coppola doubting his casting of Al Pacino, I mean its AL PACINO. Doubting. Crazy to imagine.
Brando and the cotton balls. The watermelon. The wedding.
The gun behind the water tank.
That final fucking masterful composition before the screen goes black.

There are so many images, details and quotes that I cannot get out of my head. They're burned into my brain like a childhood memory.
""The Godfather"" is so incredibly well-made and performed that it stands out amongst the very best of the best. It has become timeless.
Like Citizen Kane.
Like Gone With The Wind.
Like Jaws.

At its very core, ""The Godfather"" is a story about power, family, and the cost of it all. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is nothing short of remarkable, amd he deservingly so received the Oscar for Best Actor. Brando brings a nuanced complexity to the character, he presents Vitto with a stern eye and a smirk. This is a man who can order the beheading of a horse, and can pet a cat the same day without blinking. Brando is The Godfather, and what all Godfathers would later want to be. 
Al Pacino's transformation from a reluctant quiet one, war hero and well educated,  to the coldly calculating Michael Corleone is a cinematic journey that has never been rivaled. 
The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, deliver brilliant turns, repectively.

The film's cinematography is, like Paris, a visual feast. The use of dark and shadowy images adds an atmospheric depth to the narrative, matching the moral ambiguity of its characters. 

And then there's the haunting score by Nino Rota. I mean, come on, does it get better than this? Can it?

What sets ""The Godfather"" apart from all other crime films is the family. Afterall, in what culture is the family not held up above all other parts of civilized society. 
Above God.
Above Country.
Above Self.
And how much blood is spilt, over time and all eternity, to preserve one family over another.
A tale as old as time.

We just find ourselves caring for this family, and more disturbingly, for Michael's vision for the family. The film corrupts us along with Michael, and lets us be aware of the shared transformation. 

And fifty years later, it still has the power to keep even a frequent viewer like myself, glued to the screen to watch it all unfold.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

When using the word 'epic' one should never use it lightly where movies are concerned. This is an epic, in every sense of the word. 

Based upon Mario Puzo's exquisite novel, this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. Robert Towne deserves mentioning as well, for his part in writing the fantastic screenplay along with Puzo & Coppola. 
The story here, is everything. 

It is intriguing of course; the study of an immigrant landing in New York from Sicily at the turn of the 20th century. His struggles are somewhat skipped over (until the sequel) & we see him lording over his criminal empire. 
This was a time when gangsters had some class & really were the genuine article as far as a gangster is concerned. 
But time goes on, it waits for no man & we see the evolution of passing & inheriting; the torch is passed. 

The film was nominated for no less than 11 Academy Awards. It won 3; best picture of course, best screenplay  & Marlon Brando picked up his Best Actor award. 
In my opinion Nino Rota should've also gained a 4th Oscar for the film for his beautiful music, the theme to The Godfather. 

So, draw the curtains,  turn off the phones & settle down for a majestic three hours; make yourself an offer you can't refuse...","You and 18 other people found this helpful.","18 people found this helpful."

For some reason, I kept putting this franchise off to watch other movies. Last night I finally decided to sit down and watch this incredible movie and it simply did NOT disappoint. From the opening scene to the last, I was constantly at the edge of my seat. This is now my favorite movie of all time. Watching the transformation of Michael from being a family man to slowly becoming a cold blooded, heartless killer was spectacular. The baptism scene finale along with the restaurant scene built so much suspense and I loved it. And of course Marlon Brando's role as Vito was amazing as well, along with James Caan, John Cazale, and Robert Duvall. I'm going to watch Godfather Part 2 in a couple of days and I've heard a lot of great things about it, many say its better than the original and I'm excited to see what happens.

There are moments where the camera direction could improve, but it isn't too distracting. The first scene, the wedding scene, practically is a showcase of how well done the actors' directions are. There are a lot of subtleties, the actors and actresses look so natural, they don't look tense at all, which helps make the scene feels more real. The color scheme also helps to give an ol' time vibe. An easy 9.6. Halfway through the movie, though, I started asking myself, ""Isn't the movie essentially over?"" The major conflicts are resolved, so what will I be spending another 80+ minutes for? And in a sense, I'd probably be better off stopping there. There are a lot of good moments, one of my favorite being when Vito finds out about his son's death. His grief is ironic, a jab to what he told John about crying. The scene on marital abuse portrays the misogynistic reality, still prevalent today. Connie's anger isn't a rational action, but an understandable byproduct of continual abuse (and a narcissistic relationship). But all these come with a bitter cost: less screentime on several supposedly important characters. Why do I even want to root for Apollonia if she's portrayed as a dumbhead with no relatable qualities? A lot of characters started becoming harder to root for. Worse off? The subtleties in the first half (e.g. children playing in the street) lack so much variety they are practically reusable scenes. I know they're practically just supporting characters, but can we at least be more creative than putting the same laugh track over and over for doing random kid things?

Its combination of great acting, cinematography, dialogue, storytelling and other things make this movie a perfect movie. It also manages to keep a very slow, steady pace without being boring, which is not an easy feat to achieve. They don’t make movies like this anymore. Modern movies like Marvel are the Hollywood action equivalent of pornography. However, the reason I rated it 18+ is not just because of the content. There is that too: casual, realistic violence that could desensitize children in an unhealthy matter, drug themes, brief sexuality, and swearing (although the swearing is PG-level as opposed to a typical R-rated movie); but the complexity of the story is best appreciated by people that are mature enough to understand the aspects of the story and why it’s so good.

This is hands down the best gangster movie ever made! The most powerful, the most violent, and even the most traumatizing. Al Pacino stars as Michael Corleone, the son of mob boss Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Vito is a very powerful crime boss with a hoarse voice and he decides to one day let his son take control of the family business.

Michael Corleone was in the Marine Corps but he was discharged at some point later in his life. So the first movie of the franchise shows us how innocent Michael appears to be despite his surroundings. Over the course of the movie, we will be introduced to all the members of the Corleone crime family as well as the lawyer who is played by Robert Duvall. 

The acting is top notch, it's so great it feels like you're actually right there in the movie experiencing what's right in front of your eyes. Michael's innocence is destroyed as the movie progresses, and he turns insane and becomes vindictive for reasons I won't explain because I don't want to spoil the movie for people who haven't seen it yet.

But be warned, The Godfather has lots of very jaw dropping but also shocking moments that can leave you traumatized. You could have some of these scenes stuck in your head for weeks, the movie teaches you a valuable lesson about living a life of crime, especially if you're in a gang or you show interest in the mafia.

when i was just in the begining of my early adolescent and the cinematogy really did have a huge impact on me, the vibes and the crossfield settings of the show was just emphatic, after watching all those batman movies back when i was just a todd, it was something new, spectacularly amazing. since i was a child in early 00s i was lucky enough to be exposed in various fields, say the euros 00s, the batmans of the late 80s and the 90s, classic movies of the mid 90s, and so on, the godfather was truly an epitome that was set apart in its own league. extra ordinary. the movie is so good and i felt even more when i watched it again when i was at a maturing age in '2013, i was shell shocked, hands down one ofthe best in history, in eltie class. the cast and the delivery of the characters moved me, what can i say, when michael took over it was a bomb move and I couldn't control the euphoria it expelled. the vibrations of this movie is soo enigmatic yet the feels is fantastic like you know it. franics ford, take a bow!","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

When Puzo's book came out, we devoured it admiring it almost as a sociological treatise on the principal of ""social reciprocity"" in traditional organized crime groups. When the movie came out a mere three years later, we saw it all there again when the Don held court at the wedding handing out ""favors"" which would be ruthlessly called in later. One of our missions in rehabilitating offenders was to show them that they could receive and give favors without getting or giving anything in return except a ""thank you"" in normal society. The ""pay it forward"" notion caught on. 
The irreconcilable clash of social values was most vividly captured by Michael's (Al Pacino) need to lie to Kay (Diane Keaton) about the nature of the business so he would not lose her. This was an essential  representation of how women were manipulated and not considered ""equals"" in the crime family mentality. 
The on-screen violence was a necessary metaphor about the perversion of personal morality in gangster life brought to its ultimate climax when Sonny is killed and more vividly in the third movie when Michael's innocent daughter is slaughtered.
The Godfather is a film for the ages that is a mesmerizing morality tale as well as a historical ""snapshot"" of a sub strata of society in a bygone time.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

It thought it was okay, then I realized that I had replayed the ending about 5 times and didn’t wanna see anything else. And when a 3 hour movie makes you want to sit down and watch it again you know it must be some unbelievable level of good. I had already fallen in love with Al Pacino since I had seen Dog Day Afternoon. And I needed to see more, his performance in this movie is SO AMAZING like y’all don’t even get me started. (Also side note doesn’t he kinda look like Jake Gyllenhaal in Brokeback Mountain and Lin Manuel Miranda in general in this movie???). My only complaint (but not really even) about this movie is that the plot is a bit predictable, a lot of the time I knew what was gonna happen before it happened. But maybe I’ve just seen too many movies. One thing I did notice though, is just how incredibly influential this movie is. I bet each seen has been referenced at least 10 times in media by now! Okay yeah that’s it, what is the second best movie of all time and why is it The Godfather.

I only watched The Godfather in peer pressure. I don't even like old Hollywood films. I always start feeling drowsy while watching them. Not only is the camera quality too bleak, but the accent of the time was also very illegible. But this one was fun to watch. I saw it on Prime Video and took multiple sittings to watch this. I finished it 6 months ago but I remember seeing it like it was yesterday. Being from India, I have always thought of 70's films to be very family friendly and musical. But this isn't one of them. This one, in simple words, is metal.
The Godfather is probably what has inspired an entire genre of crime films. It is like what Star Wars is to fantasy, or what Superman is to the superhero genre (man, all 70's films have been so revolutionary in Hollywood). The whole idea of two groups of mafia fighting out each other in the most brutal way possible gave rise to Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, Gangs of Wasseypur, the Mafia game trilogy, and even this film's two sequels. That is the amount of cultural impact this film has left. Don Corleone has become a household name now.
The action scenes, the music, the acting, everything is legendary. I legit screamed at the scene where they put the horse's head in that man's bed. We see many times people learning acting by watching The Godfather films. The only problem I had, however, was what I said in the beginning of the review. The sound is not clear at all. When Vito Corleone speaks he sounds like he is swishing saliva in his mouth like a washing machine. It almost feels like the captions are saying something completely different from what the captions are saying. I finally gave up and switched to Hindi because the English ADR was so bad.
I really wish The Godfather was a standalone film. It has one of the most satisfying ending in all the old films. It really didn't need those terrible sequels which don't even have a Hindi dub. Although it has been almost 50 years since it released, it still feels like it would spark outrage among certain sections if a Bollywood adaptation would be made. Definitely way ahead of its time. I would have recommended it to everyone, except everyone I know is either not interested in cinematography or has already seen it.","You and 11 other people found this helpful.","11 people found this helpful."

So, i'll tell you what I like this movie which makes me watch it time and again. Firstly, the whole cast is amazing and they defined the 'Mafia' genre with their acting skills. It's not easy to play a role which you have no clue about and yet manage to make it your own. Secondly, Mario Puzo is a genius. He wrote a piece of history which can only be felt and not read about. You see, I didn't believe when people used to tell me things about Godfather but soon I realized that they all were right. Thirdly, I absolutely love the background score. I intensify the performances put in by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and others. It's slow, it's calming and yet, its so dangerous just like the 'Corleone' family from Sicily, Italy. Oh, yes not to forget the most important man of the legend of Godfather - Francis Ford Coppola. His vision, way of storytelling, weaving characters into the plot and his focus on the nuances has made everything amazing. Not much left to say so watch it to know more.","You and 65 other people found this helpful.","65 people found this helpful."

It seems if a film is not pouring adrenaline everywhere with a storyline as thin as gossamer (yes, I know most of those reviewers won't know what that is) and more like a video game, its a rubbish film. I'd like to bet none of them were even thought of when The Godfather was first released so have no idea of how a story is told without razzmatazz violence every 5 seconds. To appreciate it, you need considerably more than a gnats knacker of an attention span. I have no idea how they manage to binge watch some of the tv shows on offer, then have the gall to complain about the length of this film.

I've seen all three films in the trilogy many times and they certainly stand the test of time, because they are deservedly considered classics of their genre. It is a film that builds the storyline as it progresses. It doesn't lay out all it's wares up front, so there are no surprises. Nor does it completely rely on 2 or three characters, but adds background with the character actors, which support the story in this film and are carried through to the 2nd and 3rd film. 

Don't watch if all you want are big muscled brutes slugging it out at every opportunity, with more gunfire than WW2 and ever more spectacular car/bike/tank/etc chases and stunts. This is a story, requiring engagement of the brain","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

While some parts feel boring—especially in the middle—the real beauty lies in the details and the setup for the sequel. Don Vito is not just a mafia boss, but a true father who avoids violence and wants to protect his family, even if it means giving up power. The film’s strongest element is the transformation of Michael Corleone. He starts as a war hero who wants nothing to do with the family business, but as tragedy and betrayal pile up—his father being shot, Sonny being killed, the police captain disrespecting him, and the car bomb—it becomes clear that peace is not possible in a world built on violence. His shift into the role of Don isn’t just about revenge; it’s about survival and protecting what’s left. There was no clean way out for him. The ending hits hard when you realize he’s lost his innocence forever. Not a film for those seeking constant thrills, but definitely meaningful if you watch it with patience and attention.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Two very different movies.

What does The Godfather do well?  Several things.  

First, it clearly defines the characters.  Don Vito Corleone is a man of power and renown.  He has worked tirelessly to build his business and demands loyalty and respect.  His sons - Sonny, Fredo, and Michael are distinctively different from one another - hot tempered, cowering, and quietly confident.  Tom Hagen is the lawyer/consigliere lurking in the shadows.  And there are several ""associates"" ready to do the Don's bidding. 

The camera work and lighting is excellent - alternating between close ups of the characters faces and long shots of scenery or key moments involving cars.  Dark and light are used to show the slow transition of Michael's personality/soul through the movie.  

The quotes are numerous and memorable.  My favorite, ""leave the gun...take the cannoli"".

So many iconic/shocking scenes - do I need to say more than the blood soaked bed of the movie producer?

The movie touches on a variety of topics - family, business, rivalries, money, prestige, power, influence, arrogance, intelligence, pride, distrust, betrayal, vengeance, ascension, decline, age, murder, and ultimately good vs. evil.  

I have seen the movie several times and appreciate different elements.  The musical theme is very memorable and captures the mood - sorrowful, heavy, emotional.

I feel like it is a worthwhile exercise to question the movie throughout.  Why did Michael choose the path he took?  How did he arrive at that point?  Is there anything that his father could have done differently?  Were his actions justified?  What did he gain?  What did he lose?  

My only criticism is that there are so many characters to keep track of and it took me several times to understand who they were and how they fit into the much larger plot.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

This is such an important film that you can actually use it as a guide in your life
to help you make difficult decisions going forward. I always go right back to the Godfather to figure out what my next move will be or if I need to go the mattresses! In my personal opinion this is the best film ever made in the history of cinema! Be warned not to betray the Godfather or you could end up risking everything including your life! Oh, and you may want to get a cat because all the most notorious villains seem to have one on there lap as a warning sign! Just a keen observation I found very interesting as the beginning of the film opens up. Marlon Brando is found sitting in his dark study wearing a tuxedo with a red rose on his lapel. He is looking forward to spending time with his family because it's his daughter's  wedding day. Currently he is listening to a man begging for his help as he sits petting his cat gently showing him that he can be kind yet malicious! As the man pleads with him he also pledges his undying loyalty to the Godfather. He then proceeds to kiss his hand to show him his overwhelming gratitude. At this point the Godfather gives him his blessing! It's the perfect opening as the ominously beautiful musical score plays in the background setting up the entire mood for the greatest gangster film ever made! It has such an amazing cast of characters that brings the mafia family to life in The Godfather!!!","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

So glad I did as it is a superb film.  Although made in 1971-72 it has not dated, as so many films of that decade do.  Performances are superb, notably Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Pacino's face is like a mask - no emotion is shown  and he can casually order an opponent's execution as sitting down to a meal.  I also love the stillness of the movie and how family life was vividly shown - the Italian love of good food and drink.

What an absolute delight! The violence I expected (and I shut my eyes), but the love, compassion, wisdom and integrity of the lead characters I did not. This is a great story not just about the Mafia but also the strong bonds within an Italian family. The whole cast is exceptional, but the plaudits must go to Brando, Pacino and Duvall. What a treat to see them on the screen together. And Diane Keaton's understated portrayal of the mob wife who prefers not to know was excellent. The christening sequence is one of the most dramatic I've seen. Modern directors take note.

OO7","a year ago","I still don't understand why Marlon Brando rejected the Oscar after giving such a beautiful performance. Revolution for black or white, I don't think it's true. Some other reason must be there. One of the most beautiful movies ever. Its choreography, world and character-building, direction and colour pilot make this movie too special. Its colour pilot changes according to the scene. Like when something good is happening like that marriage scene at the begging. The colour pilot is bright. But, when Marlon Brando got shot at the market the colour pilot was dark before even he got shot suggesting something bad is going to happen. Not only Vito Corleone, the another gem of pop genre Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is the second heart of this film. And I just can't forget that scene in my entire life where that agent of Vito Corleone goes to that film director to tell and warm him to cast Johnny to cast in his movie. And before that, the director shows him an expensive horse of him and after that when he rejects the words of Don Corleone, 10 minutes later he sees the head of that horse in his bed and its blood covered in his bedsheet. While he was sleeping the men of Don Corleone already chopped his favourite horse's head and put it in his bed telling us how dangerous a silent and humble man like Vito Corleone is. That was brilliant. But, I find the character of Johnny selfish. I mean he came to the marriage after being a ghost for years and came back because he saw his career is ending? I liked that how this movie gave birth to anti-hero. I wasn't born even in the decade it was released and watched it on Netflix and after watching this bought the Blu-Ray also but, my money worthen. Talking to anti-villains, I heard this movie gave birth to anti-hero. Michael Corleone was shown at the beginning unlike his father he is not a gangster and he's not bad but, the situation made him enter in this world and to kill Barzani the man who tries to kill his father cause he's father didn't want to sell drugs and at the end he became Don Corleone, the same as his father. And here an anti-hero and most probably the first anti-hero of pop genre was born. This movie deserves to be watched by everyone.

One of the most gripping family sagas ever.  The head honcho played by Marlon Brando was superb.  I don’t think he needed the cotton in his mouth to help him mumble though!  Al Pacino as the quietly brooding Michael stole the show.  The rest of the cast were amazing.  My only gripe is that most of the female characters were a little one dimensional, apart from Kate.  Mama Corleone had no character build up and barely said a word, their sister (can’t remember her name) was portrayed as a neurotic spoilt brat despite being a victim of domestic abuse and Appolonia (not sure I spelt that right) was beautiful but with little personality and barely spoke.  Italian women tend to be strong and outspoken and it’s a shame this was not reflected in the film.  Despite this though, still one of the best pictures ever.

Why Marlon Brando is called a god of cinema? You would get your answer in this movie he was only 47 years old when he played Don Vito and in my opinion (including 99% of other human beings) no-one could play it better than him. I also think that any character of this movie can't be replaced or replayed by any one. This was the beginning of Al Pacino whom people consider now as a legend but long before he was legend there was only one legend and his name was Marlon Brando.
James caan and Robert Duvall were also the quick show stealers in the movie.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.

John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

It has everything good, and nothing bad.

The acting firstly is just pure class, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando really captured audiences hearts with their show-stopping performances. It was truly marvelous.

The cinematography is just divine, with all the right lighting, sound and texture. This movie is really a beauty to watch.

The plot and storyline is one of those that are just perfect and flawless.
This movie is a mix of drama, crime and a bit of romance and sadness.

The dialogue in this movie is just out-of-this-world. Seriously, a genius take of a movie.

In my opinion, the greatest film of all time. And how can we forget about the superb music scores that run throughout the song.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The story is the portrayal of the fall from grace of Michael Corleone. Michael is a tragic hero. Caught between an innocent outside world and the criminal underground of his family, he makes decisions we would've made as well.

The plotline and characters are worlds in themselves. The city itself serves as a backdrop into the fascinating world that makes this film so great.

The violence is satisfying, the scenery and camera work beautiful. Every scene in this film was a work of curated art. Not to mention the church scene which is instantly a memorable movie scene.

What I especially enjoyed in this film was the dedication to the original book that Mario Puzo wrote. Reading the book after watching the film made me appreciate the attention to detail.

First of all this movie is not for everyone and people who are looking for a family drama and comedy. It's about Mafia Gangsters and mobs and it is placed in 1950s, so don't watch this movie it you are not interested in such genres or else you would dislike this movie and call it overrated for no reason. Stay away from this movie if you're a twenty first century teen who likes modern films. The godfather is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen while watching it because of it's great acting, dialogues and interesting plot. BEST ACTING EVER!!!!!!! Marlon Brando (one of the greatest actors of all time) did a great job as always. AL Pacino, Robert Duvall and James caan played their role so perfectly that i can never imagine someone else in their place. This movie has one of the best castings in the history of Hollywood.

Puzo’s heavy Italian heritage and its influence can be seen in the mafia stories told by his books. The Godfather was written by Puzo in 1969, which is one of the most successful works. After a few years, the Book was developed in a movie that later went on to win many Academy nominations and Awards.

The plot of the book is weaved around the Corleone mafia family based out of New York. The family is run by Vito Corleone using his reasonable nature and sharp wits. Vito has shown as a man for whom friendship was the most powerful wealth one could earn. Due to conflict in business interests, the Corleone family goes to the war with the other five families of New York. The story also touches on the past of Vito and how he becomes Godfather and becomes part of the mafia. Tradition, blood, honor, power, friendship, principles and greed are a few themes that contribute majorly to the plot of the story. These themes resonate with the readers even today decades after the first print of the book.
The text of the book is so captivating that some quotes from it will get engraved on your brain muscle. Some of which are

“I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.”
“You cannot say 'no' to the people you love, not often. That's the secret. And then when you do, it has to sound like a 'yes'. Or you have to make them say 'no.' You have to take time and trouble.”
“I have always believed in friendship and I am willing to show my friendship first”

In my opinion, anyone whose brain cells are stimulated by a good story of friendship, crime and love are the audiences of the book.","You and 9 other people found this helpful.","9 people found this helpful."

Which kind of individuals are people more scared of, people who do crimes to people, who do their crimes alone, or people who are in packs or gangs, similar to wolves pack mentality?

Fear is a complex emotion, and people's responses to different types of criminals can vary. However, generally speaking, individuals may be more scared of people who commit crimes in packs or gangs, similar to wolves, as opposed to those who act alone. Here are a few reasons behind this perception:

    Intimidation and Power: Gangs or groups of criminals often exhibit a greater level of intimidation due to their numbers. They can use their collective strength to overpower and dominate others, instilling a sense of fear in the community.

    Enhanced Criminal Activities: Gangs or organized groups may engage in more sophisticated criminal activities, such as organized crime, drug trafficking, or organized violence. Their coordinated efforts and resources can make their crimes more impactful and challenging to combat.

    Group Mentality: Gangs often develop a strong sense of loyalty and identity among their members. This group mentality can lead to a higher likelihood of violent or aggressive behavior, as individuals may feel emboldened or protected by the group, making them potentially more dangerous.

    Social Disruption: Gangs can disrupt the social fabric of communities, instilling a sense of fear and insecurity among residents. The presence of gangs may lead to increased crime rates, territorial disputes, and a general sense of lawlessness, which contributes to heightened fear and anxiety.

It's important to note that individual criminals can also elicit significant fear, especially if they commit heinous acts or are notorious for their crimes. The level of fear may depend on various factors, including the severity of the crimes, public exposure, media coverage, and personal experiences.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The detailed review I had in my mind might have been a little cliche', but I want to begin speaking about the ones who criticize the film for being ""boring"", ""slow"" or complaining about its length, etc, and yes, I believe everyone is entitled to have an opinion about anything. But if you genuinely love good cinema, saying Godfather is a bad or overrated film is like being a music lover and saying Beethoven or Mozart is overrated or that their music is simply bad. Basically, you have to admit to yourself that you cant appreciate good cinema and then you may keep your opinion. 

The problem is most people are so used to fast-paced films such as action films or series like Money Heist etc, that it's extremely tough to hold their attention span for even less than five minutes unless something ""interesting"" or a ""twist"" happens throughout the film.","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

But is it really as great as is implied? I feel the same way about The Godfather as Citizen Kane and i've watched both a few times. 

There is only so much a mob movie can offer. Can we really empathize with the characters, who essentially are high-level criminals? Does it offer something for everyone? I feel a lot of people jump on the bandwagon without thinking this through. And what is the message of the film? Being a loyal 'made man' is some sort of redemption? That there is something noble about a life of crime and 'not ratting' ? That if you cross a dangerous don you get a horses head in your bed? That is how I feel about all mob films - no matter how good the direction, acting and cinematography, ultimately they are glorifying high level criminals as some sort of Robin Hood-like figures. And the Godfather arguably started this unhealthy message. 

Is being 'well-made' enough to be considered 'the greatest film ever' ?  

The Godfather is a good film - probably a great film but there is no way it is the greatest film ever made as it is so often hyped up to be. Even in the mob genre, I would say there are others that are close to the caliber of the Godfather and not as distant as some make out. A Bronx Tale for example. Brando's drawling performance was good but it, like the film, has been very overhyped. And even by 70s standards, the pace can seem slow at points. 

Some might say giving this 3/5 is a sort of blasphemy but for all the above reasons that is what I am giving it. If I was rating it out of 10 - perhaps a strong 7 but not higher. All in all I just think there are less appreciated films that are at least as good as The Godfather. 

As Peter Griffin of Family Guy said 'it insists upon itself' and in a way it does - ie a lot of people go to the template of it's greatness without really explaining why. 

To me Titanic has much more to offer.","You and 8 other people found this helpful.","8 people found this helpful."

Obviously they didn't and conspired to have him killed. Anyone, including the Godfather's enemies knew of Luca Brasso's absolute devotion to the Godfather and would have laughed and never believed such an amateurish ruse, that the Godfather's most loyal enforcer has suddenly become a turncoat. 2-: Why should Sollozzo assume that by killing the Godfather he can make a deal with his temperamental son, Sonny? And with a son of a Sicilian mafia family at that!! 3-: Why, at the midst of the war between the Godfather's family and other new York mafia families, when every member of the Godfather's family, for their protection, is brought into the family compound where the family is residing, Constance, the Godfather's daughter (who was pregnant at the time) and her husband (an active member of the mafia side of the family) were allowed to live elsewhere (seemingly at a far away location and apparently in an adjoining state) which would have clearly placed them in harm's way and in extreme danger (at the midst of a war being raged against the Godfather's family)?

 STORY : 
The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

It is full of plot holes. Its pacing is atrocious - extremely unfocused. 90% of the characters make things without any hint of what and why they will do. Characters appear and die in the next scene and the audience is supposed to be engaged. Characters with zero development betray the main protagonist. We see a lack of any substantial buildup to indicate character actions. Cinematography is terrible - mostly the lighting I mean - watching this on a modern screen I do not see anything in the dark interior shots, and people who say its shady for shady business are cringe. It hardly is in the top 10 mafia movies in my opinion. It was not ahead of its time in terms of anything - even the Mafia topic. So many films before 1972 have far better settings, plots, characters, events or lessons. The only thing I cannot speak bad about is the iconic soundtrack. Goosebumps every single time I hear it, the personification of mafia spirit and vibe.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The Godfather is one of the best movies ever made in cinematic history. It’s a phenomenal movie. The performances, from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan. The music is beautiful. 

When Michael Corleone introduced his brother Tom Hagen, I was confused; I was thinking, “If he’s his brother then why don’t they have the same last name?” I then realized that he is adopted. I heard Michael say that. 

When Don Vito Corleone got shot, I thought he was going to die, but thankfully he survived. Eventually he died from a heart attack. I felt bad for his family. 

There were a couple of scenes that made my jaw drop. Like the scene where that man wakes up and sees blood on his whole bed. Or the scene where that woman who died because the car blew up with her still in it. 

 But overall The Godfather is a masterpiece. Now I know why it’s so popular. Because it’s so well directed, well written, and well acted. It’s my new favorite movie of all time.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The poor family is more commonly viewed as being more tightly bound to one another, as a family is all that there is to value. On the other hand, the rich family is often regarded as detached for their wealth keeps them apart, a rather opportune to indulgence in luxury and vices.

The film, however, disproves this conception and shows that the rich can honor their familial relationships, as the central theme of the story follows the Corleone family.

The Corleones, a part of the syndicate that conducts “dirty” businesses, dwells on liquor and gambling. Along their venture, they inevitably grow into conflict with other families as well, this being a mere part of business. Aggrandizing criminals as they may appear, the grounds for the wars among these families are, from the outset, deeply rooted in personal feuds.

It is a war over which family is the most powerful, in which victory is sustained by how power is derived—coercion or loyalty. Power derived in coercion crumbles in a dispute, whereas power derived in loyalty endures and triumphs.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

The exaggerated acting like when Don Corleone gets shot, is laughable. When Michael gets punched by the captain. Its a simple punch and yet he swells up like he had an allergic reaction and has to clench his teeth in order to talk. Or the deaths; Luca when hes choked, the captian when hes shot in the head and takes seconds to die even though the bullet went through his brain. Sonnys over the top anger. Mike slicks his hair back and is suddenly more cruel and tough. I understand that this movie is praised, but that is because it was a product of its time. Were it released today, the movie wouldnt be praised as it is. Its full of stereotypes; it portrays Italians as always eating, drinking or cooking. The portrayals of men as powerful leaders and women as meek and quiet homemakers.

While a great many respect Francis Ford Coppola's decision to convert Mario Puzo's noir novel into a film, THE GODFATHER is riddled with violence, coarse language and a rather stereotypical depiction of Hispanic America that desecrates the true spirits of family, human connection, and romance. One who would prefer traditionally black-and-white virtue films would be wise to stay away from this gangster thriller and pursue other genres of film making.

Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

I thought I was going to have an experience I would never forget.

This movie is terrible.  All you people who keep giving it 5 stars, you 
 are sheep and can't think for yourself.  No disrespect to the mafia or Italian people, but this movie is NO GOOD.

Here is why: it was boring, uninspiring and had little to no insight about anything. It was 3 hours of dudes talking to each other and then killing each other.  That's it.

The only positive I got from this movie was in the opening scene when the man was asking the Don for a favor; to kill the men who dishonored his daughter.  The Don said, ""where were you when I needed a friend?  Now you want this favor from me?"" So this teaches people not use others just for their own benefit.  That's why it gets 1 star. Otherwise, I would give it zero stars.

One more thing you can teach yourself from this terrible movie; don't be afraid to speak your mind.  If you think the movie was bad, just say it did.  Don't just ride the bandwagon, grow a brain and analyze everything yourself.

Peace out.  And, for the record, it wasn't just a terrible movie in this era, it was a terrible movie for all era's.  I have seen movies made in the 40's and 50's that were more entertaining, inspiring, educational and fun to watch.","You and 59 other people found this helpful.","59 people found this helpful."
