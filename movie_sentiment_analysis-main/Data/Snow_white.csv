A Breathtaking Fairytale Reimagined

I walked into Snow White (2025) with high hopes, and it completely blew me away. This film is pure magic from beginning to end, and I can honestly say — I loved every moment.

First, the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. Every scene is so beautifully crafted, from the lush enchanted forests to the grand castle halls. The use of light, color, and sweeping camera movements makes the entire film feel like a dream you never want to wake up from. It’s visually stunning without ever feeling overdone — just pure elegance and wonder in every shot.

The music and songs are another masterpiece. Each song feels like it belongs in the story, adding depth and emotion to the characters and the plot. There are moments where the songs completely gave me chills — powerful ballads that stay with you long after the credits roll. The score itself is enchanting and elevates the entire cinematic experience.

The performances are nothing short of fantastic. Snow White is portrayed with so much heart — she’s graceful, kind, strong, and determined. The supporting cast brings warmth, humor, and charm to the film, and the chemistry between all the characters feels natural and heartwarming.

I also love how the film manages to honor the classic story we all grew up with, yet gives it a fresh, modern perspective that makes it feel relevant and inspiring. It’s not just a fairytale — it’s a story about courage, kindness, and finding strength within yourself, told in the most beautiful way possible.

In short, Snow White (2025) is an absolute triumph. It’s visually spectacular, musically magical, and emotionally uplifting. A film that made me smile, brought tears to my eyes, and left me inspired

Here's a 5-star review for a fictional movie, ""Snow Brown and the Seven Allies"":
A Dazzling, Heartfelt Triumph!
""Snow Brown and the Seven Allies"" isn't just a movie; it's a vibrant, heartwarming experience that left me utterly captivated from start to finish. I went in with high hopes, and this film absolutely blew them out of the water. It’s a truly fresh take on a classic tale, brimming with empathy, humor, and spectacular visuals.
The story centers on Arthur ""Snow Brown"" Brown, a character so beautifully portrayed that you can't help but root for him from his first scene. Arthur, a brilliant artist who navigates the world from his wheelchair, finds joy and self-expression through his love of fashion, particularly his stunning dresses. His journey of self-discovery and resilience is incredibly moving, and the film handles his character with such grace and authenticity. You genuinely feel his struggles and triumphs, making his victories all the more powerful.
But Arthur isn't alone in his adventures. He finds an extraordinary family in the Seven Allies, a group of non-binary individuals each with their own unique quirks, talents, and incredibly supportive spirits. Their chemistry with Arthur is pure magic. Each ally is wonderfully developed, and their diverse personalities create so many genuinely funny and touching moments. They aren't just sidekicks; they are integral to the story, offering wisdom, laughter, and unwavering friendship. Their collective strength and individuality truly shine, making this ensemble cast one of the best I've seen in years.
The film's message of acceptance, self-love, and finding your chosen family resonates deeply. It’s a powerful reminder that true beauty comes from within and that diversity should be celebrated in all its forms. The cinematography is breathtaking, painting every scene with rich colors and intricate details that pull you further into Arthur’s world. The soundtrack is also phenomenal, perfectly complementing the emotional beats of the story and adding another layer of depth to the viewing experience.
""Snow Brown and the Seven Allies"" is more than just entertainment; it’s a vital, joyful, and deeply impactful film that champions inclusivity and reminds us that everyone deserves to find their own happily ever after. Do yourself a favor and see this movie. You won't regret it!

Snow White was the first ever beloved early 20th century Disney princess and the first classic film of Walt Disney. Firstly, I watched the 1937 film before the live action of Snow White, I thought it was cute, some scenes that are scary and magical that tells the fairy tale of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". 

I was so excited to watch this new Disney live action of ""Snow White"" in the cinema that features Rachel Zegler, Gal Gadot, Andrew Burnap and the rest of cast. The casting of actors/ actresses were great. Rachel Zegler is obviously the star of this film by portraying the titular character named Snow White. 

Rachel Zegler is THEE Disney Princess Snow White, who portrayed and captures so well as the original classic character that shows her femininity and kindness to everyone. Rachel Zegler has gave me goosebumps in the cinema when hearing her singing ""Waiting on a Wish"" and other songs, her vocals were PERFECTION and SO MOVING as she embodies of what Snow White feels, dreams and also becoming fearless, fair, brave and true. In my opinion, I want Halle Bailey and Rachel Zegler to sing together because those actresses are talented and brought those Disney princesses' legacies to life. ❤❤🍎

Gal Gadot, who portrays the villain/ evil stepmother of Snow White, The Evil Queen. Gal Gadot also did well of portraying as the Evil Queen and as well as the Old Hag. When I heard Gadot sang ""All is Fair"", she really brought that villainous energy to the song. I think that Gal Gadot did a great job as the villain in ""Snow White"". ❤❤

The Seven Dwarfs. Now I know that we can all agree that Disney should have casted real life little people to portray those seven characters, but I do agree. I don't get the point of why grown adults are being overdramatic and traumatized by fictional CGI Dwarfs in a kids movie. When I saw the dwarfs in the movie, I didn't even find them sinister or creepy, I found them cute and are still funny. The CGI of the animals in the 'magical forest' scene was so breathtaking and cute. I love the creativity and designs of the CGI used in the seven dwarfs and the animals because the art of it is magnificent. ❤❤

Andrew Burnap portrays Jonathan the male bandit, but in my opinion he did technically played Prince Charming. Andrew Burnap did so well as this new male character and he was so funny and handsome. ❤❤

I think overall the movie was magical, good, but I just don't see what was the hate for this movie. I loved the film!!! In this live action, Snow White was a bit too strong and powerful as a princess, but she still has kindness by having a good heart. 

The story of Disney's live action ""Snow White"" is still the same and so as Snow White's and Jonathan's love story and their chemistry was flawless. They did add some new scenes and new seven characters who also portrayed as bandits in this film. It was too musical, but those songs were great and catchy. In my opinion, this is also one of the best Disney live action film so far. 

We get different adaptations of ""Snow White"" and this Disney live action is a combination of ""Mirror Mirror"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman""

It is 10000/10 for me!!! 

- CGI effects: 10/10
- Actors/Actress: 9.5/10.
- Special/Visual effects: 10/10.
- The plot of the story: 8/10.
- The music/songs: 9/10.

The film stands out not merely as a retelling but as an original interpretation that breathes new life into the beloved tale.

The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. Each scene is meticulously crafted to convey the ethereal beauty of the enchanted forest and the contrasting darkness of the Queen's realm. The color palette, rich in vibrant hues and subtle tones, enhances the storytelling, drawing viewers into Snow White's world with a sense of wonder and nostalgia. The special effects are seamlessly integrated, providing a magical viewing experience that captivates from the first frame.

The performances in this adaptation are particularly noteworthy. The lead, whose portrayal of Snow White encapsulates both innocence and strength, brings a fresh perspective to the character. Her dynamic range allows the audience to connect deeply with Snow White's journey, making her resilience all the more inspiring. Additionally, the supporting cast, including a formidable take on the Evil Queen, provides layers of complexity to their roles, enriching the film's narrative and emotional depth.

Musically, the score is both haunting and uplifting, skillfully enhancing pivotal moments in the film. Original songs intermingle with orchestrated themes to create an auditory experience that echoes long after the credits roll. The soundtrack complements the visual storytelling, allowing for a deeper emotional resonance that is often lacking in standard adaptations.

Moreover, the film's themes of self-discovery, empowerment, and the importance of friendship are woven seamlessly into the plot. This adaptation does not shy away from addressing the struggles Snow White faces but instead highlights her journey of personal growth and inner strength. It invites audiences to reflect on their own challenges while celebrating resilience and courage.

In conclusion, the 2025 adaptation of ""Snow White"" is a triumph that pays homage to its origins while establishing its own identity. It successfully combines stunning artistry with profound themes, delivering a film that is both entertaining and meaningful. This version of ""Snow White"" is not merely for children but is a cinematic experience that resonates with viewers of all ages, making it a must-see for anyone who appreciates quality storytelling in film.","You and 23 other people found this helpful.","23 people found this helpful."

**A Fresh and Enchanting Reimagining – Live-Action *Snow White* Shines Bright**

Disney's *Snow White* has returned to the silver screen in a spellbinding live-action adaptation that blends nostalgia with new magic. From the very first scene, it's clear that this is not just a retelling — it's a revitalization.

The film's visual splendor is immediately captivating. From lush enchanted forests to the intricately designed castle interiors, the production design creates a fairy tale world that feels immersive yet grounded. The cinematography is equally stunning, with each frame evoking the charm of the animated classic while embracing a modern cinematic flair.

The heart of the film is undoubtedly its lead. The actress portraying Snow White brings warmth, strength, and sincerity to the role. Her performance strikes a perfect balance between innocence and quiet resilience, making her both a classic Disney heroine and a modern role model. Her vocals during musical numbers are beautiful — emotive, rich, and respectful of the original songs while offering a fresh interpretation.

The supporting cast adds depth and humor, especially the Seven Dwarfs, whose updated portrayals are both respectful and inventive. The Evil Queen is deliciously menacing, and her scenes sizzle with dramatic intensity, aided by impressive visual effects and a memorable performance.

The musical score and reimagined songs are another highlight. Whether it's a revamped version of “Someday My Prince Will Come” or a newly introduced anthem of self-belief, the music uplifts and complements the story's emotional beats.

Most importantly, this adaptation stays true to the spirit of *Snow White* — kindness, courage, and hope — while gently updating the narrative to reflect values of self-agency and empowerment that resonate with today’s audiences.

In short, Disney’s live-action *Snow White* is a triumph of heart and craft. It's a loving tribute to a beloved classic that also carves out its own identity. Whether you're a longtime fan or discovering the story for the first time, this film offers a truly magical experience.

Only watch this if you have absolutely nothing to do and want a good laugh. It finally got on Disney+, so here’s my 2 cents. Warning: there is a reason why this movie failed the box office TWICE!

Absolutely horrendous. Really weird production and casting choices. Why hire people who can’t sing for SINGING roles (I am NOT talking about Rachel 🙃)? This movie is the perfect example to avoid hiring actors based on star power, and not SINGING ability (studios, PLEASE take note!). Really, the singing is so bad, I thought BOTH the Gal and Andrew (a bandit/the love interest) had no experience in singing. But apparently, Andrew (first time I’ve ever heard of him and a BAD first impression) starred in a Camelot musical in 2022? What happened there? Were his vocals edited to be worse or was he always that bad? He’s 34, old enough to have gone through a lot of singing coaching and he sounds like he’s tone deaf? And all the autotune the editors gave Gal couldn’t save her performance. Stupidly, they didn’t autotune Andrew’s vocals 🙃 (my poor ears…) Rachel sang alright but the songs were all pretty forgettable. And her duet with Andrew suffered because his singing is so distractingly awful (that man wouldn’t be able to sing himself out of a paper bag 😒)

The costumes are so atrocious, I’ve seen COSPLAYERS make better. They look like high school theater costumes, not something that you’d expect from a movie with a $200m budget. A very far cry in quality from when they started doing their live action remakes. 

The story tries to explain and shoehorn story changes in a really forced and awkward way. Especially the romance between captain bandit and Snow White (honestly, not very convincing when the actors have 0 on screen chemistry…). This is the first time I’ve ever seen this Rachel woman act. Is she always so deadpan? It’s like as if she doesn’t know what to do with her face. Honestly, it feels like the writers rewrote the script so many times that the story becomes completely incoherent. Or they just quickly wrote whatever and didn’t get a second opinion or whatever on the writing. Did it not get a screen testing at the LEAST? Lmao! Like when the sun stops shining in the kingdom because the queen closed the gates to the kingdom. That makes no sense! 😀 How does closing a gate block the sun from a kingdom?! Was it supposed to be queen’s doing? What was her reason? The movie doesn’t give an explanation. At least THAT’S how I understood it. If I’m wrong, then blame this sloppy storytelling.

Also, what I really don’t like is that this was supposedly written to be “girlboss” movie, yet Snow White only ever mentioned her mother TWICE in the entire movie.  She dedicates an entire song (my father’s daughter) to her father and keeps repeatedly mentioning him throughout the entire movie, but her mother is mentioned once in regular dialogue, and in one line of the last song? What is with that?

And, I don’t *think* this is spoilers, but the movie simultaneously uses two meanings of the word “fair.” When referring to Snow White, it means to be a “kind leader.” But when referring to the QUEEN, THAT is the only time when it means “pretty”?! No, that’s messy writing. Choose ONE. It’s so bad, I laughed.","You and 195 other people found this helpful.","195 people found this helpful."

Rachel Zegler is THEE Snow White for this film! She did an awesome and stunning job with her performance! Young woman with an amazing voice! I love it so much! This is the Snow White we all need today. This was a different take on the original version in 1937 for sure but it was still spectacular. I believe that the main point Disney is trying to get across with in these live action remakes is that women are empowered and not just a damsel in distress. In this version, Snow White is the same person just like in the classic. She is sweet, gentle, and kind. I really love how she took herself as a leader, because she is the royal princess of her kingdom. This new version made it so much better than the original version, in all the best ways possible.

I think Gal Gadot was a great Evil Queen. She was meant for this role. If you compare her to the original Evil Queen, they look so similar. Gal's acting for the Evil Queen was spot on. Her singing was great! I think ""All is Fair"" was a little challenging to sing, but she did it no problem. The film makers also gave us more scenes of the Evil Queen to understand her story of how she took over the kingdom, in respect to Gal. Awesome portrayal in her first iconic villain!

Andrew Burnap was perfect for his role as Jonathan. He almost looks like prince charming from the original version. His singing was spectacular and charming, and his relationship with Rachel was lovely.

I feel like the use of CGI for the Dwarfs is necessary for this film. If you imagine real actors as the Dwarfs, the movie would not be similar to the original version. I think the CGI complaints come from people who watched Snow White and the Huntsman, which the Dwarfs were real actors. CGI Dwarfs in this new version helps honor the original looks for the Dwarfs. This live action is meant to be magical, and inspiring to others, and I believe they accomplished that here!

Go watch it yourself! Believe me, it's so worth it!! I would go see it a second time to feel that child-like wonder in me in a realistic way again! Please for the love of God, do not hate the movie before you watch it. Show it lots of love and understand that Disney wants to honor the original version by making this new high tech movie! 👏❤️🍎","You and 253 other people found this helpful.","253 people found this helpful."

A Dazzling Reimagining: Snow White Shines with Heart, Magic, and Modern Grace

The Snow White remake is a breathtaking triumph—a spellbinding blend of classic fairy tale charm and bold, contemporary storytelling that breathes new life into one of Disney’s most iconic stories. From the very first scene, it's clear that this isn’t just a retelling, but a thoughtful reimagining that honors the spirit of the original while confidently stepping into a new era.

At the center of it all is the dazzling performance by the lead actress, who embodies Snow White with a perfect mix of innocence, courage, and conviction. She’s not just a damsel in distress—she’s a heroine who commands her own destiny. Her chemistry with the ensemble cast, especially the delightfully reimagined seven companions, is warm, heartfelt, and often laugh-out-loud funny.

Visually, the film is a feast. The lush forests, the intricately designed palace, and the stunning costume work create a fairy-tale world that feels both timeless and refreshingly modern. The use of practical effects, clever CGI, and vibrant cinematography makes every frame worth lingering on. The iconic magic mirror sequence alone is a masterclass in visual storytelling.

The musical score is another standout, featuring a mix of updated classics and new songs that soar with emotion and energy. The compositions are memorable, with lyrics that speak to themes of empowerment, resilience, and self-discovery without losing the whimsical tone that audiences expect from a Disney fantasy.

But perhaps the film's greatest triumph lies in how it subtly weaves in themes of agency, identity, and unity without feeling preachy or forced. The evil queen is more than a caricature—she’s a complex antagonist with real motivations, making the story richer and more emotionally resonant.

In short, the Snow White remake is a shimmering jewel in the crown of modern fairy tale cinema. It’s a film that honors the legacy of the original while speaking directly to a new generation. Enchanting, empowering, and endlessly entertaining, this is the kind of movie that stays with you long after the credits roll.

Five stars. A modern classic is born.

(Read below for an honest review and NOT how previous reviews were copied just to spread hate on this beautiful Disney remake)

Rachel Zegler IS Snow White. Definitely a superb performance from her!! Small girl with a big voice. Innocent yet brave. I love it!! That's the Snow White we need NOW. Rachel was brilliant!! A different take on the original film but for me it was an improved version especially nowadays wherein women are empowered and not just a mere damsel in distress. I believe that's the main point of remaking these classics. Remaking it in a sense that how these stories can project values that can be applicable in the modern times. We are already in the modern era unlike before wherein women are always being saved by a prince charming. Snow White in this version is still so gentle, sweet and kind like how we knew her before but also leveled up as a leader because she is and always will be! She is the heir to the throne which btw seems forgotten in the original movie! New version made it waaaaay better than the original one! 

On the other hand, I think Gal Gadot made an effective Evil Queen. Evil Queen should be perfect in every angle as she is the face of narcissism and vanity and picking Gal for the role was a good choice. Gal is SO FAIR AND BEAUTIFUL AS ALWAYS! She actually look like the actors playing Evil Queen in Disney lands. I appreciate her production number as well. Didn't know Gal could sing! It was not perfect, okay?? Don't expect her voice to be perfectly in tuned but I think it was great! ""All is Fair""  is not easy to sing but the fact that she nailed it, I could say she has potential in singing. Also, for those saying they want more from Evil Queen, what more do you want??? If you will watch the original film, Evil Queen was just that. Thanks to the film makers they gave us more scenes from Evil Queen in respect to Gal. 

Also, I would like to commend Andrew Burnap for his role as Jonathan! Ugh, can't give any spoilers here but he was good!! Though I wished he could have a solo performance because he sings so well. Good job for hiring a Broadway star for this role! Plus, his chemistry with Rachel is just ughh!! Hearts all over!! 😍

As for the CGI issue for the dwarves, I believe making use of CGI is necessary in the film. If I try to imagine it with real persons, it would lose its impact. The dwarves are meant to be cute and adorable and cuddly. Especially Dopey! I think these comments from some audience is due to the movie Snow White & Huntsman wherein real people were asked to play the seven dwarves but that one has a different attack on the story. That one is more action-packed and is more on gore. But this live action is meant to be a feel good movie! It is meant to be magical and colorful and inspiring which I think they accomplished! 

There were few twists made in the new version but it was executed well without skipping the important parts from the original movie. Plus points to Pasek and Paul for the amazing songs!! Please please more music from them i feel like they are meant to make Disney songs!

Go watch it yourselves, believe me, it's worth it!! Also, if I may ask, Please refrain from hating the movie prior to watching it. Judge it after!👏😍🍎","You and 510 other people found this helpful.","510 people found this helpful."

As if the world of Star Wars couldn't get any better, just when I thought the world of our Star Wars heroes was coming to an end we now get all that happens in the next generation starting here. The legacy of our beloved Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, General Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa has come to an end and now to think they have returned again to show their spunk, spirit, power, strength, skill, strategy, heart, determination and light one last time in the new generation of the Star Wars world, our beloved actors Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford all aged beautifully just as I knew they would and even the return of Kenny Baker as R2-D2 and Anthony Daniels as C-3P0 and Chewbacca is just as mind blowing and amazing as ever. I was even stunned and amazed by the return of the Millennium Falcon, my favorite starship in the entire galaxy. I was also most definitely impressed by the new members of the Star Wars family such as John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and even Andy Serkis, they all provide such amazing and outstanding spunk, spirit and power to their characters. Out of all the newest characters I've seen in this masterpiece my favorite one is BB-8, now I have 2 favorite droids which is both R2-D2 and BB-8 and I just love both of them so very much. Poe Dameron is such an unbelievable pilot and one of the best I've ever seen, Finn is one of the most loyal and headstrong fighters I've ever seen, Rey is one of the most incredible, fierce, headstrong and spirited fighters I've ever laid my eyes on which means that after Luke Skywalker I had a feeling she would be the next big hero to save the day and the galaxy, Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke is just as amazing and incredible as he was as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit trilogies and of course Kylo Ren is definitely another one of the most fiercely determined, headstrong, very spirited and outrageously impressive fighters I've ever seen, even if he fights for the Dark Side of the Force and he also is known by another name he still amazes and astounds me a lot. The fact that the next generation for the Skywalker family goes on with the grandchild of Darth Vader joining the Dark Side and trying to finish what he started is completely shocking and unbelievable, but I suppose it had to go on at some point. I thought I felt bad for Anakin Skywalker and what happened to him before, but this takes a completely different turn after I found out what happened to his grandson, poor Kylo Ren a.k.a Ben Solo. I didn't really mind that Mark Hamill only made an appearance in the end and didn't get any lines in this masterpiece, I know it was for a reason why and I guess they just wanted to wait until the next big release so that they could develop the new characters more and so they could contemplate on what really happened to Luke after all that happened in Return of the Jedi. If you're dying to know what happens next to our beloved Star Wars heroes and how the next chapter in their story goes than you've got to get your head in the game and see this masterpiece for yourself, if you like it than awesome don't stop there keep on going and if you don't than no worries you can't please everybody. So Grab Your Lightsaber, Climb Back On Board The Millennium Falcon, Hold On Tight and MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!!!!!

The children in both screenings were no trouble. Didn’t talk much, but did react to the cute CGI animals. 

They also didn’t seem to be scared of the witch like I thought they would be. 

In the first showing a 5 or 6 year old boy and girl ran down the stairs and started dancing in front of the screen along with the dancers in the wedding scene. And their 11 year old brother was still sitting in the attentively watching comfortably position.

In the next showing another little boy ran down the stairs in the middle of the very romantic scene when Snow White and the bandit rebel leader Prince Charming, sing to each other A Hand Meets A Hand, and tried to catch the bubbles falling down from the ceiling. Then like a good kid went back to his seat without having to be told. I noticed he liked the hedgehog. 

And his father? During a smoky Evil Queen scene, decided that he need the bathroom… but in not so much of a hurry that when the smoke machines suddenly went off… he decide to turn around, quickly run up a couple of steps, immerse himself in it, and then go to the bathroom…

This film makes a kid of us all. 

I hope that helps. 

“Fearless, fair, brave, and true”

“If there's a world where you wake me
Promise to wake me with a kiss""

A lovely simple, sweet, romantic, and VERY family friendly movie with no innuendos for adults, nothing bad in it, just nice old fashioned wholesomeness for kids. Good morals, adorable dwarfs, and so many cute CGI animals. It’s beautiful to look at. A loving homage to the original. 

I’ve never seen her films before but Rachael Zegler oozes loveliness in this. In fact the whole movie does. 

She and the man who is her Prince, are very charming to watch. Gal Gadot looked exactly like the Evil Queen. It suited her. She also knew how to move her body well. 

Small children though, may be a little scared of the witch, but will probably ooo and ahh at the cute CGI Deers, Doves, Blue Birds, Butterflies, Squirrels, Rabbits, Hares, Badgers, Mice, and Hedgehog.

It's an excellent remake of a beloved and perfect original.","You and 181 other people found this helpful.","181 people found this helpful."

I walked into Snow White (2025) with high hopes, and it completely blew me away. This film is pure magic from beginning to end, and I can honestly say — I loved every moment.

First, the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. Every scene is so beautifully crafted, from the lush enchanted forests to the grand castle halls. The use of light, color, and sweeping camera movements makes the entire film feel like a dream you never want to wake up from. It’s visually stunning without ever feeling overdone — just pure elegance and wonder in every shot.

The music and songs are another masterpiece. Each song feels like it belongs in the story, adding depth and emotion to the characters and the plot.

The score itself is enchanting and elevates the entire cinematic experience.","You and 76 other people found this helpful.","76 people found this helpful."

The performances are nothing short of fantastic. Snow White is portrayed with so much heart — she’s graceful, kind, strong, and determined. The supporting cast brings warmth, humor, and charm to the film, and the chemistry between all the characters feels natural and heartwarming.

I also love how the film manages to honor the classic story we all grew up with, yet gives it a fresh, modern perspective that makes it feel relevant and inspiring. It’s not just a fairytale — it’s a story about courage, kindness, and finding strength within yourself, told in the most beautiful way possible.

In short, Snow White (2025) is an absolute triumph. It’s visually spectacular, musically magical, and emotionally uplifting. A film that made me smile, brought tears to my eyes, and left me inspired.

One must stand in awe before the unparalleled genius that is Snow White (2025) — a film that boldly redefines the very essence of cinematic storytelling by daring to unravel every expectation with unparalleled subtlety and nuance. It is, without hyperbole, the apotheosis of fairy tale reinterpretation, where originality meets… well, something almost entirely new.

The narrative, a labyrinthine odyssey through the realms of predictability, captivates with its relentless devotion to tropes we all know and adore. The refreshing decision to retain the enchanted apple as a plot device—how quaint!—serves as a masterstroke of innovation, proving that the past is best never truly left behind.

Our heroine’s portrayal is nothing short of transcendent. The performance effortlessly oscillates between a porcelain doll’s fragile innocence and an inexplicable aura of stoic resilience, thus granting audiences a complex psychological portrait that could only be described as profoundly ambiguous. One is left to ponder: is Snow White asleep, or merely deeply invested in existential reflection? Such ambiguity!

The Seven Dwarfs, those paragons of character development, receive screen time with an economy so minimalist that one cannot help but admire the director’s bold commitment to brevity. Each dwarf, a veritable cipher, invites viewers to project their own emotional baggage—truly an avant-garde approach to ensemble casting.

Visually, the film dazzles with a palette so meticulously muted that it redefines ‘dark and brooding’ for a modern audience. The cinematography’s exquisite austerity transforms every frame into a chiaroscuro tableau of longing and despair—because who doesn’t crave a fairy tale steeped in shadowy introspection?

In conclusion, Snow White (2025) is a cinematic tour de force that will undoubtedly ignite fervent debate among scholars, cinephiles, and casual viewers alike. Its fearless embrace of the familiar, coupled with a subtle defiance of conventional joy, renders it a landmark achievement in contemporary film. Bravo! Five stars—for courage, for daring, and for the exquisite art of leaving audiences wondering what, exactly, they just watched.","You and 6 other people found this helpful.","6 people found this helpful."

Created by Joe Brumm, this Australian animated series is a breath of fresh air in the world of kids' television. Instead of the usual frenetic, often mind-numbing content, Bluey offers something different: a show that is both incredibly entertaining for children and genuinely enjoyable for adults.

The premise is simple: it follows the daily lives of a family of anthropomorphic dogs, focusing on Bluey, a six-year-old Blue Heeler, her younger sister Bingo, and their parents, Chilli and Bandit. Each episode is only about seven minutes long, and they all revolve around a central theme, usually a game or an everyday activity. From playing ""Keepy Uppy"" with a balloon to setting up a pretend ""bus"" in the living room, the show captures the pure joy and chaos of imaginative play.

What makes Bluey stand out is its emotional intelligence. The show handles complex themes like disappointment, empathy, and resilience with remarkable subtlety and grace. The parents, Chilli and Bandit, are particularly noteworthy. They aren't perfect; they get tired, they get frustrated, but they consistently engage with their children in a way that is both playful and profoundly respectful. They model fantastic parenting, and it’s a joy to watch them navigate the ups and downs of family life.

Ultimately, Bluey is more than just a cartoon—it's a celebration of childhood, family, and the power of play. It’s a show that will make you laugh, maybe even tear up, and it will definitely remind you of what’s truly important. In a sea of kids' shows, Bluey is a rare gem that has earned its place as a classic. It’s highly recommended for anyone with kids, or anyone who just wants to reconnect with the simple magic of being a kid again.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

I love all of that, and I stand with that. I think wokeness in society needs to be more accepted and I hope Rachel keeps chasing her vision, she did an amazing job and her acting was phenomenal.

Her singing was enchanting, and her portrayal of this kind and compassionate character was moving. I also love that her love interest was not a prince, but a bandit whom she ended up having a real connection with. Making Snow White into a bleeding-heart and compassionate leader, a representation of women's empowerment and leadership, and a magical sweet princess is wonderful and I love seeing that.

My only criticism is that they didn't hire real actors for the dwarves, which if they did it would have been an improvement. However, the CGI was well-done and the dwarves all look like nice wonderful magical creatures you'd find in fae fairy tales. I also wish Rachel's Snow White had fuller curly hair, but her hairstyle in the movie is unique and is a reflection of going against the grain a little bit.

No matter how much people like to hate, I stand with Rachel Zegler's idea and I love her movie, it was a great Snow White and the storyline was great. The wokeness made me happy and I loved seeing the movie. It was magical in so many ways, kept to some original elements while incorporating a unique twist and creating something new and interesting.

Visually, the movie is a feast. The production design is lush and immersive, capturing the magic of the original while introducing bold, modern visuals. The forest scenes in particular are stunning, full of life and enchantment. The costumes balance fairytale elegance with a contemporary flair, subtly reflecting the film’s message of personal agency and growth.

The soundtrack deserves its own praise—soaring orchestral pieces mingle with new original songs that are catchy, emotional, and thematically rich. One standout ballad delivered by Snow White herself is sure to become a Disney classic.

Director [Director’s Name] has managed a rare feat: honoring a beloved story while making it feel entirely new. The updated themes of courage, compassion, and self-belief make this Snow White not only relevant for today’s audiences but truly inspiring.

The seamless integration of live-action performances with CGI elements enhances the storytelling, creating a visually stunning tapestry that honors the original while embracing modern filmmaking techniques.​

Musically, the movie strikes a harmonious balance between nostalgia and innovation. Beloved classics like ""Whistle While You Work"" and ""Hi-Ho"" are reimagined, evoking fond memories, while new compositions, such as the duet ""Princess Problems"" between Snow White and Jonathan, add fresh layers to the narrative. ​

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen offers a nuanced depiction of the iconic villain, adding complexity to the character's malevolence. Her performance, combined with the film's commitment to character development, enriches the story, providing a deeper exploration of themes like leadership, bravery, and self-discovery.​

Overall, this adaptation of ""Snow White"" stands as a testament to Disney's ability to reimagine its classics with grace and creativity. It delivers a heartfelt and visually enchanting experience that appeals to audiences of all ages, reaffirming the timeless magic of this beloved race mixed tale.","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

Rachel Zegler completely embodied the role of Snow White, her performance was heartfelt, and she brought a perfect balance of innocence, strength, and charm to the character. You could tell she truly understood the essence of Snow White and gave her a fresh yet respectful portrayal. And Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen? She was fantastic! She exuded elegance and menace in every scene, making her one of the most captivating versions of the character we’ve seen on screen.

I know this film received a lot of hate before it was even released, and while I understand why some people had concerns, it truly didn’t deserve the level of backlash it got. The movie itself was fun, enchanting, and filled with heart. The CGI dwarfs, while a different take from the classic version, were absolutely adorable and brought so much humor to the film. Their personalities shined, and they added a wonderful dynamic to the story.

This is a great family-friendly film that both kids and adults can enjoy. The music, the performances, and the magical feel of the movie made it such an enjoyable watch.

Directed by Marc Webb, the film breathes new life into the classic fairytale, blending nostalgic charm with a modern sensibility that makes it feel relevant for today’s audiences. Rachel Zegler delivers a standout performance as Snow White, balancing innocence, strength, and compassion in a role that demands both vulnerability and quiet resilience. Her voice is beautiful, her screen presence magnetic, and she effortlessly captures the essence of the original character while giving her more agency and depth. Gal Gadot is a scene-stealer as the Evil Queen, embracing the role with a wicked elegance and flair that adds complexity to one of Disney’s most iconic villains. The dynamic between Snow White and the Queen is compelling and layered, making the stakes feel personal and emotionally charged. The film’s visuals are nothing short of enchanting. From the lush forest landscapes to the whimsical charm of the cottage and the mirror’s haunting beauty, the production design and cinematography create an immersive fairytale world. The costumes, especially Snow White’s updated dress, strike a perfect balance between classic and contemporary. The musical elements shine, with new songs that expand the emotional range of the story without overshadowing its heart. The choreography and orchestration are vibrant, and the musical numbers feel both organic and uplifting. Though it takes creative liberties, the story retains the spirit of the original, a tale of kindness, courage, and self-discovery. The updated message empowers without losing the fairytale magic, appealing to both nostalgic fans and a new generation.

First, what on earth happened with the script? Did the writers completely forget how to tell a coherent story?

The pacing is a disaster, and the film contradicts itself constantly. For example, when Snow White storms the palace to confront the queen, the people instantly recognize her as the princess—despite the film previously establishing that she had been completely forgotten.  

Then there's Jonathan, a character the movie tries to sell as a ‘Robin Hood’ figure, yet he does nothing to earn that title. He serves the king without ever showing any real connection to the people—so why should the audience buy into his supposed heroism?  

Gal Gadot’s singing? A disaster. It was so strained that not even autotune could salvage it. Her voice cracked multiple times, and honestly, she would have been a better fit voicing the old hag than the glamorous Evil Queen.  

As for her acting—I expected it to be mediocre, but this was another level of lifeless. Even a GPS voice sounds more engaged. There was no depth, no menace, nothing memorable at all. It’s baffling how she keeps landing major roles.  

The costumes? Atrocious. Whoever designed them should reconsider their career. They look like cheap knockoffs from a discount costume shop, completely lacking the elegance or magic you’d expect from a Disney production.  

And let’s talk about Snow White’s hair. Who thought it was a good idea to give her a style that makes her look like Lord Farquaad? Out of the hundreds of people working on this film, not one person thought, “Maybe this isn’t the best choice”?  

### The Dumbest Plot Points:  

— Snow White’s locket says both ""Fearless"" and ""Brave."" These words mean the same thing. With a $209 million budget, you’d think someone would have caught this redundancy.  

— The most absurd moment? The queen’s soldiers suddenly switching sides because Snow White “remembers” them. There’s no real reason for them to turn against the queen, other than the fact that Snow White’s family once handed out apple pies years ago. If their loyalty was that flimsy, the kingdom should have collapsed long before.  

— The CGI dwarves? Nightmare fuel. They look like Alvin and the Chipmunks after a nuclear accident. Disney could have simply hired actors with dwarfism, but instead, we got whatever this was.  

This film is a disgrace to the original classic—a soulless, uninspired cash grab that lacks charm, heart, or any justification for its existence.  

What a shame. This movie is garbage.","You and 334 other people found this helpful.","334 people found this helpful."

Disney's Snow White (2025) is less a remake and more a cinematic trainwreck wrapped in glitter and buzzwords. This movie isn’t just bad—it’s historically terrible. If you thought Cats was the lowest mainstream cinema could go, brace yourself: Snow White 2025 brings new meaning to creative bankruptcy.

Story? What story?
Once upon a time, there was a beloved fairy tale. Now, there’s just two hours of narrative sludge with more plot holes than the forest has trees. The script is so shallow it makes a puddle look like the Mariana Trench. Snow White doesn’t grow, doesn’t struggle, doesn’t do much of anything except talk in vague inspirational Pinterest quotes.

Characters: Unrecognizable and Unlikable
The titular character is no longer “the fairest of them all”—not in spirit, nor in performance. Instead of grace and charm, we get arrogance wrapped in a lifeless delivery. The dwarfs? Gone. Replaced by a random collection of diverse side characters who feel like checkbox fillers rather than real people. The Evil Queen, one of Disney’s greatest villains, is now just a cranky lady with no menace, no depth, and no eyebrows.

Visuals and CGI: A $200 million mess
How does a movie with this budget look this cheap? The forest looks like it was rendered on a PlayStation 2. The magic mirror should be sued for defamation—it reflects nothing but mediocrity. The costumes swing between Renaissance fair rejects and fashion disasters. And let’s not forget the color grading that makes everything look like it was filmed through a dirty windshield.

Music: Forgettable at best, torturous at worst
There’s not a single memorable tune. Disney used to deliver magic through its music—this one sounds like AI-generated pop gone wrong. “Someday My Prince Will Come”? Nope. He ghosted this movie like everyone else should have.

Dialogue: The real villain of the film
Every line feels like it was written by someone who’s never spoken to a human being before. Forced quips, pseudo-inspirational monologues, and awkward feminist slogans crammed into every other sentence. It’s not empowering, it’s embarrassing.

Moral of the story: Don't fix what isn't broken
Disney’s attempt to “modernize” Snow White strips it of all charm, elegance, and emotional core. It’s not progressive; it’s regressive. It’s not bold; it’s bland. A beloved classic was gutted, Frankensteined, and dragged onto the stage under a dying spotlight.

Final Verdict: A cinematic disaster of poisoned proportions.
Skip this movie. Burn your Disney+ subscription if you must. If you need to watch Snow White, the 1937 original is still waiting with a warm smile and real magic. This version? It's a nightmare, not a fairy tale.","You and 144 other people found this helpful.","144 people found this helpful."

The dwarfs added much humor, clear emotions and enjoyable comic relief that really brought the movie to life. Jonathan’s character was exceptionally well developed, and his performance was a standout in the film, despite the settings and scripts being a bit off. After Finally making it to the end I was relieved to see Snow White wake up with the true love’s kiss, with everything in original films changing nowadays, that preserved some childhood memories .Overall, this movie is not for everyone, but if you can overlook the bad even when it is veryyyy noticeable you may still find a few beautiful moments worth enjoying.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

The pacing is awful, and there are so many unanswered questions. For example, when Snow White marches to the palace to protest, everyone immediately recognizes her as the princess—but wasn’t it stated earlier that the people had completely forgotten she even existed? 

Not only that, Jonathan’s character is lacking—the film portrays him as this ‘Robin Hood’ character, yet he is anything but that—he fights in the name of the king, but what has he done for the people before he met Snow White?

Gal Gadot’s singing was so bad that even autotune couldn’t have saved her, you could hear her voice cracking when she was singing. She should have just voiced the old woman, her voice suits that role better. 

To address Gadot’s acting, I already knew she wasn’t great, but I didn’t expect her to be this terrible—even my GPS sounds more invested in what it’s saying. It was bland, forgettable, and completely devoid of any emotion. God knows how she is so famous.

As for the costumes—whoever designed them needs to quit immediately. They are clearly not cut out for this job. They look like something you’d get at a theme park gift shop—absolutely horrendous. 

The singing? I’ve heard Zegler sing before, and she has a beautiful voice, but it is absolutely not suited for Snow White. And while we’re at it—what the hell is going on with Snow White’s hair? Why does she look like Lord Farquaad? Who thought this was a good idea? Did not a single person in the hundreds of cast and crew members look at that hairstyle and think, ‘Maybe this isn’t a good idea’?

The Stupid Plot Points:

— Why does the locket that Snow White wears around her neck say both ‘Fearless’ and ‘Brave’? They are both synonyms. I’m aware that this is nitpicking at its finest, but come on, the movie had a budget of 209 million—and yet they could not be bothered to fix this. 

— The most ridiculous thing of all—is when the soldiers change sides because Snow White remembers who they are. It’s not a bad thing if it’s executed well enough, but in this scene, it wasn’t. They don’t give the people a reason to care for Snow White other than the fact that her and her family baked apple pies and gave them out to the people a couple of years ago. Not only that, if it took that little effort for the soldiers to switch sides then the Evil Queen’s kingdom would have collapsed long ago. 

— The CGI dwarves look as if Alvin the Chipmunk and his friends were caught in a radioactive fallout—it was unsettling. Why could they not hire people with dwarfism?

This movie is an insult to the classic that changed Walt Disney’s life and defined so many childhoods. A soulless, poorly written mess with no heart, no charm, and no reason to exist.

What a shame.","You and 252 other people found this helpful.","252 people found this helpful."

But this movie was and is terrible, absolutely terrible.

The storyline is questionable at best. Songs which lack warmth and depth- there's no innocence. Snow White comes across as smug rather than heartfelt, showcasing Rachels disregard to what the original character was all about. Gal Gadot sounds as though she has never acted a day in her life. The ""prince"" is dull. He was merely put there because fans wanted the love story. The dialogue felt like it was written by AI. The CGI was also terrible which is shocking considering it was the same company who gave us the incredible Davy Jones. 

The magic mirror changes what ""The Fairest Of Them All"" originally meant. It wouldn't be such a criticism if it didn't create a plot hole. During the original film and book, the fairest of them all was linked to physical appearance, it had nothing to do with how a person behaved or how beautiful they were on the inside. The new movie of course changed the meaning to that beauty is found within, and who is the most kind and just. The change was made to be more modern. However this merely creates a plot hole because The Evil Queen was once ""The Fairest Of Them All"". I now ask how was she? She is not kind, neither is she beautiful on the inside- she is cruel. So her being the fairest of them all is a plot hole which makes zero sense. 

Snow White has no motherly tenderness unlike the original Princess. She is instead rather cold and seems as though she is almost full of herself. Snow White during the original cartoon won the dwarves over by being sincere and kind. Whereas Snow White during this movie was immediately asserting dominance, trying so hard to be a leader. She is extremely unlikable. All of the side characters lack character growth and depth... there's no development.. So in short you don't care about them. Snow and her ""lover"" also have zero chemistry, leaving all of their scenes cringeworthy. 

The movie also suffers from poor pacing, so poor it came to the point where I questioned if any real writers even tried during this project. 
The lead actress has no love for the original, and it is displayed within her performance as there's no essence of the original character. Despite her good vocal training and obvious talent in singing, there's no emotional quality within the songs. It's like you're being yelled at constantly. The songs feel dead in comparison to its predecessor. 
No suspense on the Queens parts. No depth to Snow White. Costumes appearing as though they were from Temu. 

In short. This movie ruins a timeless classic. No character arc, no life, no romantic chemistry, music which is uninspired and forgettable. The overall visuals are artificial. Costumes cheap. No magic, no authenticity unlike the original. Bad pacing. Bad acting. 

This movie singlehandedly ruined what was once a cult classic. Disney claim to respect Walt Disney, however from this movie I question thar. Snow White saved Disney from becoming bankrupt. The move didn't just pave the way for Disney, but for animation in general, without Snow White we wouldn't have the animation movies we have today. The movie that MADE them, and THIS is how they treat it? Unbelievable.","You and 14 other people found this helpful.","14 people found this helpful."

Knowing people’s names is actually a very useful skill we all need to possess. Its a first step to show people you care about them.
So many good values we can have from this movie. I would recommend it for children. The music and cinematography is great. It keeps the classic storyline about the apple and true love kiss. But this time the princess is not only kind, lovely and a good singer, but also wise and brave to fight the queen for her people.

So even if this may not  be the best movie of the year if you’re into fairytales, its definitely worth watching.

Minus 1 star because:
- I prefer the dwarves played by real actors instead of cgi
- need a little improvement on the costume area","You and 18 other people found this helpful.","18 people found this helpful."

The performance and songs were great, Rachel Zegler and Andrew Burnap both had chemistry as Snow White and Jonathan, which made their character's relationship more believeable and their song ""A Hand Meets A Hand"" was cute. Gal Gadot was frickin awesome as Evil Queen Grimhilde, she was both menacing and just downright EVIL and I loved it! It was also cool Disney gave her a Villain Song in ""All Is Fair"". The Seven Dwarfs were also pretty funny and love that Dopey got some charcter development too. And yes people, Disney didn't forget any of the original songs as new versions ""Whistle While You Work"", ""Heigh-Ho"", and ""The Silly Song"" are featured.

The only big critiques that I have were the mostly with the CGI especially The Dwarfs themselves, I still debate weather Disney should've used real Drawf actors or not. I also believe that Jonathan should've been added to the film's promotion posters because he is the third main character.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

The Evil Queen delivers dramatic flair, the dwarfs bring laughs and heart, and Snow White’s songs add a layer of sweet nostalgia.

Now, Andrew Burnap as Jonathan? Talk about unexpected! 🙌 His character is so much more than just a “bandit” – there’s so much depth and complexity there, and he totally surprised me. The chemistry between him and Rachel? OFF THE CHARTS! 😍🔥 They were so natural together, it was like they were the story.

And the visuals?! Don’t even get me started. Cinematography was straight fire – magical, mystical, like a dream come to life. 🎥✨ The soundtrack? Pure vibes, it hits just right, adding that extra layer of emotion. Honestly, this movie is more than just a remake; it’s a whole new take on Snow White that feels fresh, modern, and still keeps that old-school magic alive. Definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a fresh twist on a classic! Can’t wait for round two! 🎬🤙","You and 52 other people found this helpful.","52 people found this helpful."

The result? A strange, hypnotic spectacle that walks the line between satire and surreal family horror. 
Director Ava Brightwell (Disney's rising auteur behind last year’s Peter Pan: Urban Nights) brings a mesmerizing visual language to this version of American Psycho. Gone is the gray, sterile look of early-2000s corporate Manhattan. Instead, the city pulses with stylized pastels, shimmering reflections, and kaleidoscopic transitions that evoke a hyper-clean, almost dreamlike world—one where violence is always just under the surface, but never quite shown.

The framing is tight and unnervingly symmetrical, echoing Patrick Bateman’s obsession with perfection. Frequent wide-angle shots of his apartment (reimagined here as a high-rise smart condo with AI-voiced furniture) contrast with surreal closeups that shimmer like polished glass. Light dances off every surface. Blood is replaced with splashes of red confetti or ominous digital glitch effects—more disturbing than one might expect. Think Black Mirror meets Fantasia.
Timothée Chalamet steps into the designer shoes of Patrick Bateman with eerie elegance. His portrayal is softer, more performative—a man pretending to be a monster, rather than a monster pretending to be a man. He brings a musicality to the role, leaning into Bateman’s performative charm rather than his depravity. There are moments where his monologues feel like musical numbers—rhythmically delivered, choreographed with subtle movement, yet always teetering on the edge of breakdown. He’s less terrifying than Bale’s original Bateman, but more unsettling in how much he resembles someone you’d follow on TikTok.

Supporting performances sparkle: Zendaya as a morally ambiguous Jean (now a mindfulness coach/personal assistant), and Donald Glover as a charismatic, scene-stealing Detective Kimball, who jazzes up each interrogation with noir-style narration and saxophone-backed dream sequences.
Disney’s American Psycho is not the film anyone asked for, yet somehow it commands attention. It strips away the original’s gore and brutality but keeps the soul—layered in family-friendly surrealism and stylized menace. The cinematography is undeniably stunning, like watching a twisted Apple commercial directed by Wes Anderson. The acting is pitch-perfect for this reimagined universe: charming, deeply unsettling, and just cartoonish enough to remind you this is still under the Mouse’s banner.

Is it a satire of consumerism, influencer culture, or the sanitization of danger? Maybe all of the above. But one thing’s for sure—Patrick Bateman has never looked so marketable.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

While it may have underperformed at the box office upon its initial release, Treasure Planet has aged incredibly well and deserves its modern-day status as a cult classic. This is a film that takes a daring, and ultimately successful, risk by mashing up Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel Treasure Island with a futuristic, sci-fi aesthetic. The result is a stunningly original and visually rich adventure that holds up beautifully.

The animation is a particular highlight. The blend of traditional 2D animation for the characters and dazzling 3D CGI for the spaceships and environments creates a unique and immersive world. From the majestic ""Legacy,"" a solar-powered schooner sailing through a nebula, to the bustling, alien-filled spaceport of Montressor, every frame is packed with imagination and detail. The character design is also top-notch, especially for the film's breakout star, John Silver.

Speaking of which, the relationship between the rebellious young protagonist, Jim Hawkins, and the cyborg cook, John Silver, is the emotional core of the film. It's a complex and genuinely moving dynamic, perfectly balancing the mentor-mentee bond with the inherent tension of Silver's true intentions. The voice acting, particularly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jim and Brian Murray as Silver, is fantastic and brings a real depth to these characters.

The film isn't without its flaws—some of the side characters, like the overly frantic robot B.E.N., can be a bit grating at times. However, these are minor quibbles in an otherwise grand and heartfelt story. Treasure Planet is a testament to Disney's willingness to innovate and a truly underrated gem that deserves to be rediscovered by new generations of fans.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

While the film takes some creative liberties compared to the original, I believe these changes enrich the story. It teaches children and young women to be kind, brave, fearless, and true, emphasizing that true beauty comes from within. The focus isn’t on replicating every iconic detail from the Disney parks, but rather on delivering a heartfelt love story and a powerful lesson about inner beauty. I left the theater feeling that unmistakable Disney warmth, inspired and uplifted by a modern fairy tale that resonates with both the heart and the spirit.

Critics argue that such adaptations compromise the integrity of timeless stories, suggesting that if DEI principles are to be highlighted, they should be applied to original narratives rather than retrofitting established classics.

A significant point of contention is the casting of Rachel Zegler, a Latina actress, as Snow White—a character traditionally depicted with “skin as white as snow.” This decision has sparked discussions about fidelity to source material and the balance between inclusive casting and narrative authenticity. Zegler addressed the backlash, expressing pride in representing a Latina princess and emphasizing the importance of inclusivity in storytelling.  ￼ ￼

Further controversy arose from the portrayal of the seven dwarfs. Actor Peter Dinklage criticized the remake for perpetuating outdated stereotypes, leading Disney to reimagine these characters as “magical creatures” and consult with the dwarfism community to avoid reinforcing negative portrayals. However, this move was met with mixed reactions, with some actors with dwarfism expressing concern over lost representation opportunities.  ￼ ￼ ￼

Additionally, Zegler’s critiques of the original 1937 film, labeling it as outdated and advocating for a modernized narrative, have fueled further debate. Her comments about the original film’s themes and character dynamics have been polarizing, with some viewing them as a necessary evolution, while others see them as a departure from the story’s core essence.  ￼

These controversies underscore the challenges of integrating contemporary values into classic tales. While the intention behind incorporating DEI principles is to promote inclusivity and representation, critics argue that altering foundational elements of beloved stories can dilute their original messages and cultural significance. They suggest that creating new narratives that authentically embody DEI values would be a more effective approach, allowing for fresh storytelling that resonates with modern audiences without compromising the integrity of classic tales. ￼

In conclusion, the Snow White remake serves as a focal point in the broader conversation about how best to honor traditional narratives while embracing the evolving landscape of inclusivity in media. Striking a balance between preserving the essence of classic stories and promoting diverse representation remains a complex and nuanced endeavor.","You and 49 other people found this helpful.","49 people found this helpful."

it has the disney magic and it expands on many points in the animated version that were not elaborated on. the prince is actually there for most of the movie and not just 2 min at the end. everyone was so worried about snowwhites love story when this movie gives her more of a love story then the original ever did and they even have a very cute song together. 

snow white is not a high pitchy annoying little baby but a strong girl with agency. and yes she is still falling in love with the guy dont worry guys. 
The prince got a story in this movie and one i do not hate. his actor is very good and charming and captured the part very well. 

and hot take but i actually prefer what they did with the dwarves. making them cg made them look like magical dwarves, something that just couldnt be achieved with human actors. And like everything in this movie the dwarves have more story to them and theres a little side plot with snow white and dopey and its absolutely the sweetest thing ever.

This isn’t just a bad movie—it’s a soulless, creativity-deprived insult to anyone who has ever experienced happiness.

From the very first scene, I could feel my brain cells packing their bags and leaving. The film is a lifeless, preachy slog, completely drained of fun, charm, or even basic entertainment value. It’s as if the writers were trapped in a corporate boardroom, forced to craft dialogue that neither humans nor animals would naturally speak. Every scene drags like a funeral procession, only without the emotional depth.

The lead performance? A charisma vacuum. This version of Snow White has all the warmth of a malfunctioning robot, stumbling through scenes with the energy of someone who was forced to be there as part of a court-ordered sentence. And the not-dwarfs? Don’t even get me started. They have the personality of wet cardboard, delivering lines with the same enthusiasm as a hostage reading off a ransom note. Watching them interact felt like watching a bad improv group that forgot to say “yes, and.”

Visually, the movie is a disaster. A fairy tale should be magical and full of wonder, yet somehow, this film looks like it was shot in a dimly lit storage unit. The CGI is so janky it makes The Polar Express look photorealistic. It’s as if every scene was rendered by a broken PlayStation 2.

The pacing is even worse. I sat there, watching this endless trainwreck unfold, praying for something—anything—to break up the monotony. At this point, I would’ve given this movie a 10/10 if Lizzo had descended from the sky, dressed as Peter Griffin, rolling onto the screen in a wheelchair while blaring an airhorn. That alone would’ve justified my suffering. But no. Instead, I was left with nothing but despair.

And just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, I realized the biggest betrayal of all: they didn’t even have Bill Cosby sitting at a table with Supergirl, eating scrambled eggs, and then passionately making out with her on the couch with Kamala Harris. That, at the very least, would’ve given this movie a moment of unpredictability, something to break up the soul-crushing boredom. But no. Instead, I got this—a movie so lifeless, so aggressively terrible, that I can only assume it was created as some kind of social experiment to see how much human endurance can withstand.

Final verdict? Snow White (2025) is an unwatchable, soulless embarrassment. It takes the magic of the original and replaces it with corporate sludge, designed only to waste your time and drain your will to live. If you love yourself, avoid this film like the plague. If you hate yourself, well… even then, you deserve better.","You and 63 other people found this helpful.","63 people found this helpful."

I have two daughters and want them to be strong and independent who don’t need a man. It’s 2025! That ship has sailed and Disney has made that very clear in this movie and I love that aspect!

I thought the dwarfs were adorable. Of course Dopey was my favorite for obvious reasons, but I love how we found out why he doesn’t talk. 

Gal Gadot as the evil queen was masterful! She played her so well! I really felt the evil queen come out of her.  Lol it scared me a bit but in a good way because she captured the part so well! Also, her costumes were gorgeous! 

I liked how we found out about Snow White’s parents, especially the mother because that wasn’t in the original. The dwarfs cottage was so cute and the inside reminded me of the original which I did appreciate that. I always thought the cottage was so cute so I was glad they didn’t make too many changes to it. 

Lastly, Rachel Zegler as Snow White was genius! She did so well. I don’t seen anyone else playing that part. She made Snow White brave and courageous and helped Snow White brave enough to stand against the evil queen! She didn’t need to ride off into the sunset with Prince Charming!!!

I loved every moment of this movie. The haters haven’t seen this movie and if some of them did, the point went right over their head 🙄

- Rachel Zegler singing
- CGI Animals; the animals are adorable so as the views from the dwarfs home and the deer animals in the forest. 
- The storyline 
- Gal Gadot Costume; I think the costume designer who did Gal costume really made her character as an evil queen. 
- Andrew ( Jonathan) the character and acting 

What the movie needs improvement 

- Gal Gadot Acting; I think is extremely underrated but I think Gal is trying to hard to be a villain as the evil queen that she forgotten the other aspects and personality of the evil queen as a character. 

- Rachel Zegler Acting; i couldn’t see any romantic attraction between Jonathan and Snow White; while Snow White was looking at Jonathan I hardly seen any romantic attraction however on the other hand if I didn’t knew the plot I will think it was just two random people looking at each other. 

-  Gal Gadot singing; I definitely hope and pray Gal practice more on her singing before the role as her singing in who is the fairest of them all is unnecessary and weird.

- The ending; I felt the ending was practically odd how Snow White just awaken everyone memories just by talking about their past lives as I think it is just really mediocre  and bland with Rachel stiff acting. 



Overall, I hope Disney gets dwarfs actor the chance to act in dwarf characters instead of CGI and writers not to put female empowerment in every Disney movie as I believe as a female girls can be female bosses or pursuit true love so does boys. 

As believing in female rights, writes shouldn’t all place one gender above other also can Disney cast someone who loves the original for their princess not like Rachel who spoke numerous times she was scared of the ride and the original movie the prince “stalked” the princess and an actress that respects their co stars where she said in an interview “maybe all Andrew scenes will get cut who knows it’s Hollywood baby. “

WEIRD WEIRD if it was a guy this actor will be cancelled in Hollywood already.

PS: Rachel if you don’t like the role or the original movie don’t  apply for it bae, lots of people will love to act Snow White and pls can Disney find an actress or actor that fits the cartoon . 

Sometimes I ponder what is Disney live action they will produce next example such as:Jada Pinkett Smith as Rampunzel; to not offend girls without hair or Sabrina carpenter as Tiana bc it’s not correct only for a black lady to achieve dreams or lupita nyong'o as Elsa and Jodie Turner Smith as Anna bc Nordic country might have black people.

If Disney is so afraid to offer one specific community just bc of one actor then it’s a good sign to leave the classic alone!","You and 690 other people found this helpful.","690 people found this helpful."

Gal Gadot's terrible performance as the Evil Queen, who had the chance to shine but was unable to save this mess, is, in my opinion, worse than the story being altered.  She is portrayed as a one-dimensional caricature rather than a genuinely frightening antagonist. In addition to the awful persona of Rachel Ziegler, her performance veers between ridiculous theatrics and uninteresting moments, never achieving the proper balance as she delivers her lines with the depth of a cardboard cutout.  How could her character ever be seen as affectionate, gentle, vivacious, and modest?  Snow White has never been described as ""opinionated"" in any universe; her personality is evident in this adored character.   Employing real little people rather than the awful computer-generated imagery of the seven dwarfs.  They have no personality, no chemistry, and, to be honest, no reason to continue and hire new performers.  Change everyone, improve your public relations staff, and manage your actors.  Even woke news outlets despise it, so it's not even about woke stuff anymore.  The Independent: ""Lazy, visually repellant""  Guardian: ""Exhaustingly awful""  ""Disney has trashed its reputation.""  The Times  It was ""a strange, hot"" mess. —HuffPost  ScreenDaily's ""Listless""  ""Good enough... for TV""  Vanity Fair  ""Film has a major identity crisis.""  —BBC. Not to add that Snow White's singing has changed genre.  Rachel's voice is supposed to be celestial and angelic, but now it's just a conventional pop song.  Her voice doesn't help, though perhaps that's because of the writers.  The most well-known songs, such as My Prince Will Come, were altered because they didn't match their shoddy narrative.  A dull ""bandit guy,"" who has no chemistry with Snow White, takes the place of the usual prince. Snow White continually saves him in situations that seem more absurd than empowering, and their interactions appear forced and unpleasant.  Her role as a leader frequently comes across as entitled rather than inspirational, particularly when she pushes the dwarfs around, breaks into a house, and takes over someone's bed.The kindness and grace that characterize the Snow White we know and love are very different from this.  Disney's Snow White is dull and something no one really wants.   They took one of their most famous fairy tales and made it into a self-righteous, lifeless lecture with poor computer graphics.

The colours, the animals, the forest, and her dress were all so beautiful and gave the movie a magical touch. I highly recommend. Go and enjoy.

At the heart of this dazzling reimagining stands Rachel Zegler, who delivers a performance that is as powerful as it is poignant. Her portrayal of Snow White is not the damsel of yesteryear, but a heroine of depth, conviction, and quiet strength.

Zegler brings a refreshing intensity to the role, effortlessly balancing vulnerability with a commanding sense of purpose. She doesn’t wait for rescue—she leads. Whether navigating treacherous forests or standing up to injustice, her Snow White is brave, bold, and fully in control of her own destiny. It’s a performance that redefines what it means to be a Disney princess in the 21st century.

What’s especially striking is Zegler’s fearless commitment to breathing new life into such an iconic character. In a role steeped in history and expectation, she brings authenticity, modernity, and grace, proving that strength can be quiet and that bravery often lies in simply staying true to oneself.

With stunning visuals, heartfelt storytelling, and a lead performance that inspires and empowers, Snow White is more than a film—it’s a statement. Rachel Zegler doesn’t just play Snow White—she becomes her, setting a new standard for fairy tale heroines for generations to come.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

Cinderella: Her dog was the footman and the horse was the coach not lizards and a goose, she didn't help the mice make the dress, she didn't meet the prince before the ball, the sisters never apologized. 

Belle: There was no scene with her mother and what happened to her, the Beast wasn't given a magic book by the enchantress, it wasn't always winter at the castle. 

Mulan: Mulan didn't have a sister, there was no Mushu or cricket, they didn't sing the song Make A Man Out Of You or Reflection, Mulan wasn't being called Ping like in the original movie.

Aladdin: Genie never had a love interest, Jasmine wasn't originally with him during One Jump Ahead, Jasmine didn't have a maid friend, 

The Little Mermaid: Prince Eric didn't have a song, his parents were never mentioned or seen, there wasn't a scene with the chef and Sebastian, Scuttle didn't have a song, 

My point is, that not everything was accurate in the other live action Disney Princess movies and yet they were still loved, and in my opinion, Rachel Zegler was an AMAZING Snow White, I literally could not think of anyone better after seeing her. they also kept the details in the dwarfs cottage, the queens costume when she sang All Is Fair, the dwarfs mines. I especially loved how she met Johnathan before her journey began just like in the original, (wearing only rags and showing kindness). This is just MY OPINION and I believe the Snow White live action was AMAZING, Rachel Zegler if  you ever see this, know that I think you're the fairest Disney princess of all.","You and 20 other people found this helpful.","20 people found this helpful."

This isn’t a reimagining—it’s a lobotomy of a classic, a joyless, preachy slog that stomps all over the original’s charm and replaces it with a mess of bad CGI, worse writing, and a cast that looks like they’d rather be anywhere else.

Let’s start with Snow White herself, played by some poor soul who’s clearly been told “smirk more” is a substitute for personality. This isn’t the sweet, resilient heroine of old—she’s a “girlboss” caricature who spends half the movie lecturing the dwarves on empowerment and the other half staring blankly at CGI apples. Her singing? Auto-tuned to death, like a Siri cover of a lullaby. The romance with the prince (sorry, “non-binary forest guardian” now) is so devoid of chemistry it’s like watching two cardboard cutouts bump into each other.

The dwarves—oh, the dwarves. Disney’s bold “update” turns them into a generic squad of quirky hipsters: one’s a vegan influencer, another’s a tech bro with a drone, and none of them feel like they belong in a fairy tale. Gone are the distinct personalities—Doc, Grumpy, Dopey—replaced by a focus-grouped blur of snarky one-liners and forced diversity that lands like a lead balloon. Their CGI makeover is a nightmare too; they look like rejected Pixar rejects with uncanny-valley faces that haunt your dreams.

The plot? A convoluted mess. The Evil Queen, played by a slumming-it A-lister, hams it up like she’s in a pantomime, but her “tragic backstory” about patriarchal oppression feels tacked on and laughably earnest. The mirror’s now a snarky AI voiced by an overpaid comedian who won’t shut up, and the poisoned apple bit gets swapped for some eco-warrior subplot about saving the forest from a logging corporation. By the time Snow White “dies” (spoiler: she doesn’t, because stakes are for suckers), you’re begging the coma to take you instead.

Visually, it’s a disaster. The budget clearly went to overblown green-screen forests that look faker than a theme park ride, while the costumes are a garish mix of thrift-store rejects and haute couture gone wrong. The musical numbers—because of course they kept those—are forgettable slop, with lyrics so on-the-nose (“I’m strong, I’m me, I’ll break the chains!”) you’ll cringe yourself into next week. The choreography looks like it was improvised by a TikTok dance crew on a lunch break.

And the message? Hammered in with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Every five minutes, someone’s preaching about self-love, systemic inequality, or climate change—noble ideas drowned in sanctimonious drivel that forgets this is supposed to be a fairy tale, not a TED Talk. Kids will be bored; adults will be insulted.

Snow White 2025 is a soulless cash-in that buries its legacy under a pile of woke clichés, shoddy effects, and a script that feels AI-generated—ironic, given the mirror. Disney’s poisoned this apple themselves, and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. Skip it, burn the DVD, and rewatch the 1937 version to cleanse your soul.

The silly song dance scene should have been longer , the mine scene could have been slightly shorter. The classic song someday my prince will come classic iconic melody should have stayed in the movie somewhere as an instrumental or changed the lyrics to match the updated storyline more. However the new songs were enjoyable and very well done . Snow White was in need of better hair and makeup aka -a real cute Bob haircut and soft brighter make up- rosy pink cheeks and light blue eyeshadow with lash extenders to compare to The evil queen’s glamorous look. At the end the edit is awkward by editing off her make romantic lead’s handsome man’s face who saves her life twice -to just her,  and uncharacteristically selfishly ends the storybook with only her alone on the last page- instead of her with all the people and animals who she cares for and who all care for her surrounding her.

Not in a metaphorical, ""oh, it's a bit disappointing"" way. I mean it's a full-on, toxic, cinematic disaster.

Where to even begin? Let's start with the ""updates."" Oh, the ""updates."" This film seems to have taken the classic tale, shoved it into a blender with every trending social commentary point, and then splattered the resulting mess across the screen. The original's charm, its simple yet powerful fairytale heart, is utterly obliterated. Instead, we're subjected to a heavy-handed, preachy narrative that seems more concerned with checking boxes than telling a compelling story.

The visuals? Don't even get me started. For a Disney production, the CGI is shockingly, appallingly bad. The enchanted forest looks like it was rendered on a mid-2000s video game console. And the reimagined portrayal of the dwarfs? Utterly distracting. The CGI used for them is so poorly executed, that it takes you completely out of any sense of immersion. Instead of being charmed by their characters, you are stuck wondering why they look so unnatural.

Then there's the script. Oh, the script. The dialogue is clunky, the pacing is atrocious, and any semblance of emotional depth is buried under layers of forced exposition. The characters feel less like inhabitants of a magical realm and more like mouthpieces for the writers' agendas. Key elements of the original story, which are beloved by generations, are altered to the point of being unrecognisable. And not in a good, ""fresh take"" kind of way. In a ""why did they even bother?"" kind of way.

And the music? Let's just say the new songs fail miserably to capture the magic of the original. They are bland, forgettable, and often shoehorned into scenes where they simply don't belong. It seems like they tried to hard to make new ""hit songs"" and forgot to make songs that fit the film.

The performances are equally lackluster. While some of the actors try their best, they are ultimately hampered by the terrible script and direction. The overall feel of the movie is that of a cash grab, and a very poorly executed one at that. It feels as if the people that made this film, do not understand the source material, and do not care about the audience that loved the original.

In conclusion, this ""Snow White"" remake is a soulless, unnecessary, and frankly insulting attempt to capitalize on nostalgia. It strips away everything that made the original film special, replacing it with a hollow, preachy mess. If you have any love for the classic animated film, do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this cinematic travesty.

The Little Mermaid and now Snow White are perfect examples—people grew up with a certain image of these characters, and suddenly they look and feel completely different. It’s not about being against inclusion—it’s about where and how it’s done. Creating new stories with strong, diverse characters would probably be celebrated way more than changing ones that have meant something specific for generations.

The original Snow White had a very specific fairytale identity, and by changing that too much, it not only loses its roots but also confuses the story for younger generations.

Kids should be able to look up to all kinds of heroes, no doubt—but rewriting every classic to fit a “everyone can be everything” mold waters down the uniqueness of those stories. Snow White was never about “everyone can be her”—it was about her specific qualities, charm, innocence, and yes, the symbolism in her appearance, which had a poetic tie to the story’s themes.

Instead of reshaping everything that already exists, maybe it’s better to create new characters that represent all types of people—without erasing or rewriting the old ones. That way, kids get both: the classics as they were and new heroes that reflect today’s world.","You and 75 other people found this helpful.","75 people found this helpful."

I don’t know Rachel Ziegler but if her opinionated, 20 something, entitled social media outbursts stop you going to see this movie then you are missing a pretty good film going experience.  Also, virtually all the nonsense about this being a terrible movie is untrue.  This is a well told story with great production values and some decent singing and dancing. Jonothan (really Prince Charming) is a rebel living in the woods who is a supporter of the missing King. The miners (the 7 dwarves) are a 274 year old group of blokes who, even though they produce more wealth in a day than Elon Musk does in a year, choose to live together in a cottage in the woods and sleep in the same room.  Snowwhite is the true heir to the throne as the only child of the missing King, forgotten by her people and demoted to housemaid status by her father’s second wife the Evil Queen who obsesses about being the best looking person in the land while  generally oppressing the peasants and stealing the wealth of the Kingdom. It’s basically a mash up of themes found in ‘Braveheart’, ‘Robin Hood’ and ‘Che Parts 1 and 2’ with cute woodland creatures thrown in. A wholesome fairytale of people trying to make a go of socialism while retaining a monarchy - much like the SNP during the ‘Yes Campaign’ in Scotland a few years back. Don’t believe the haters and go see this for yourself. You won’t regret it - unless you are triggered by seeing a princess awakened from a ‘sleep of death’ spell by receiving ‘love’s first kiss’ from a bloke way below her social status while surrounded by weeping dwarves with disproportionately large animated heads.","You and 6 other people found this helpful.","6 people found this helpful."

It’s interesting to see how much debate the film has sparked, especially since much of the criticism seems to stem from expectations of a ‘fairer and prettier’ actress, overlooking the true essence of the story. Snow White has never been about just physical beauty; her kindness, wisdom, and the way she treats others with love are what make her ‘the fairest of them all.’ And the songs? They are just as heartfelt and meaningful as ever, in true Disney fashion. Rather than focusing on rigid stereotypes, it would be wonderful if audiences embraced the timeless messages these stories carry. After all, storytelling is about growth, understanding, and keeping an open heart.","You and 120 other people found this helpful.","120 people found this helpful."

Scary parts - The scene where she runs through the forest can be intense for younger viewers, and one character gets shot in the heart. Mentions of killing, and bringing her heart to the Queen in a box. The way the Queen dies might scare young ones.
Romance - kissing, nothing much. She gives consent to when he kisses her while she's asleep in a song - ""wake me with a kiss."" 
Songs - catchy, modern Disney songs. Gal Gadot's voice wasn't the strongest, but Rachel Zegler blew it out of the water. Fun and jazzy, and definite ear worms.
Animation - the dwarves weren't as bad as people thought they were going to be, and the animals looked somewhat believable. Enough to trick younger viewers, and I appreciate that they kept the dwarves in. 
Originality - kept most of the major plot points in, while adding new character and songs. Snow White was definitely more defiant and headstrong, and the relationship with her love interest had a modern spin. 
I don't know why people were giving so many bad reviews! I feel as if some didn't like the cast, so they rained all over the movie..I saw some bad reviews before it even came to theaters!

Disney’s Snow White is the cinematic equivalent of microwaved oatmeal—bland, mushy, and something nobody actually wants. They took one of their most iconic fairy tales and turned it into a lifeless, self-righteous lecture wrapped in bad CGI. Watching this movie feels like doing homework, except the lesson is “how to ruin a classic in under two hours.”

Let’s talk about Rachel Zegler, who plays Snow White with the enthusiasm of a DMV employee. She spent the entire press tour dragging the original movie like it personally owed her money, and then had the audacity to step into the lead role. That’s like auditioning for Batman and saying, “I think Gotham’s whole crime-fighting thing is a little outdated.” If you hate the story that much, why are you even here? Oh right—Disney’s paycheck.

And don’t even get me started on the Seven Dwarfs—oh wait, sorry, the Seven Randomly Generated Background Characters. Instead of the charming, memorable dwarfs, we got a group that looks like they fell out of a failed CW fantasy pilot. Another looks like he’s about to drop a mediocre indie album. They have zero chemistry, zero personality, and quite frankly, zero reason to exist.

Then there’s Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. This woman is supposed to be the most terrifying villain in Disney history, but she delivers her lines like she’s ordering at Starbucks. The original Queen had power, presence, and pure evil energy. This one feels like she’d send Snow White a passive-aggressive email instead of trying to kill her.

Now, let’s talk about the budget—$250 MILLION. For what? The CGI looks like it was made in a high school computer lab, the costumes have less detail than a Spirit Halloween display, and the set design has all the creativity of a corporate training video. I swear, Disney must have burned most of the budget on lattes and HR meetings because it definitely didn’t go into making the movie watchable.

And then there’s the box office disaster. This movie flopped so hard, archaeologists are gonna dig it up in 1,000 years and think it was a warning from an ancient civilization. Disney really thought they could strip everything magical out of Snow White, throw in some half-baked “modern updates,” and people would still buy a ticket. Newsflash: audiences actually like the original stories, not these soulless remakes that have all the charm of a DMV waiting room.

Final thoughts? This isn’t Snow White—it’s No White. No joy, no heart, no entertainment, just a two-hour-long mistake that Disney will pretend never happened. At this rate, their next remake is gonna be Cinderella, but instead of losing a glass slipper, she loses her will to live after sitting through this movie.","You and 221 other people found this helpful.","221 people found this helpful."

Forget the classic fairytale where Snow White was, you know, a character with a story arc. Instead, we get Brown Snow who’s obsessed with inclusivity, activism, and making sure everyone gets a participation trophy. Her job? To empower everyone around her with the “right” kind of narrative. Gone are the days of evil queens and magic spells; now we’re drowning in endless corporate buzzwords like “equity,” “allyship,” and “unconscious bias,” all wrapped in a confusing, dull package that’s somehow worse than the poisoned apple.

The dwarfs? Don’t even get me started. They aren’t even dwarfs anymore. We now have a “diverse team” of tiny humans — sorry, “vertically challenged individuals” — who are less about mining gems and more about making sure no one feels excluded from the conversation. It’s like a group therapy session for people who aren’t really sure what their purpose is but are all about being seen. It’s honestly exhausting to watch. I came for some fantasy, and all I got was a corporate diversity seminar. Where’s the magic, the adventure, the fun?!

And the Prince? He doesn’t save Snow White. He doesn’t even kiss her. Instead, he lectures her about “intersectional power dynamics” and “navigating systemic oppression.” Ugh. I’ve had enough of this. What happened to the prince that could just sweep a princess off her feet without needing a lesson in DEI?

The Wicked Queen is the most frustrating part. She’s not an evil stepmother anymore; she’s a misunderstood woman struggling with “toxic beauty standards” and “internalized patriarchy.” Sure, let’s just make the villain a victim of society’s problems instead of, you know, just a villain with real evil intentions. This is not a fairytale. This is social commentary disguised as a children’s movie.

This Snow White is a classic case of ""we're going to shove woke ideology down your throat and call it progress."" It’s so painfully obvious that it’s not even subtle. It’s less about creating an enjoyable film and more about checking off boxes to satisfy the DEI police. I'm exhausted.

I didn’t pay for a lecture on systemic oppression. I paid for Snow White to, you know, fall into a coma after biting a poisoned apple, and for the dwarfs to do something other than sit in a circle and talk about how they’re “challenging traditional narratives.” If you’re tired of movies trying to sneak in woke agendas where they don’t belong, avoid this one like the plague. It’s not a fairytale. It’s a woke nightmare.","You and 50 other people found this helpful.","50 people found this helpful."

Omg I was completely blown away by Disney. Snow White was never my favorite princess even though I resembled her. I didn’t like that she had like trusting issues you know opening the door to a stranger and eating a food from a complete stranger. Ariel was always my favorite, but I wasn’t completely blown away with the remake one like this movie did. I mean I still love her, but this movie did blow me away more. This movie though made me love Snow more than I ever did. So if you never really loved Snow White I guarantee now you will. I was also disappointed that I’m Wishing song and someday my Prince will come wasn’t it, but that’s ok because the songs added were more up to date and fun.
Spoiler Alert
I liked how the movie went in a totally different direction. Going more in depth about what the kingdom was like and how Snow’s parents died. It was very interesting how they decided to make Snow a forgotten princess. I liked all the songs. They definitely made the songs more fun and catchy. I liked how they went more into the prince character because they didn’t do that in the original. The dark forest always used to scar me as a kid they definitely made it more frightening, but I’m an adult so I’m able to handle it. Her falling reminded me of Alice in wonderland. Her going underwater was different. The animals were adorable. I expected the dwarfs to be creepy, but you actually get used to them. I fell in love with how Snow tried to make everyone get along. I liked how Snow went more into the forest and meet up with the bandits and Johnathan. Happy that they kept the kiss in it. The chemistry between them is so cute. I liked that there was some action too. I was glad after the kiss Snow got her kingdom back. The queen dying in the mirror reminded me how in Serena Valentino’s villain book she went in the mirror as well. I was happy to see Dopey talk now.

Overall this live action was one of the best. Go see it!!! Thank you Disney for making this one of my favorite princess live action movie remake and making me fall in love with Snow White","You and 79 other people found this helpful.","79 people found this helpful."

     Don't listen to the haters (most of which are racist people judging Rachel by the coler of her skin). This movie vastly improves upon the original that we all know and love. Disney has done a marvelous job updating the classic fairy-tale for modern audiences.

     There are small things, for example the cgi animals and dwarves look amazing. As well as the costuming is on point. I personally prefer Rachel Zegler's wide vocal range over the original Snow White's voice.

     Then there are the big things. This Snow White isn't waiting for a prince to save her. In fact, she doesn't marry a prince at all. Her main goal is to become the queen her father and mother knew she could be. She wants to restore her kingdom from the evil queen.

     Who she dose end up marrying is a common bandit boy who helps her defeat the queen. His name is Jonathan and he is just delightful.

     Dopey, gets his own character arc in this version where Snow helps him be brave enough to talk by the end of the film. It's absolutely heartwarming.

     Next, Gal Gadot is having the time of her life playing the role of the evil queen. She relished in how deliciously evil that character is. Her performance is outstanding.

     The dwarves are now magical immortal beings that mine for gems. The forest that Snow runs into is full of magic itself.

     The movie could have gone ultra feminist and had Snow White reject romance all together. But the movie thankfully doesn't do this. Twice in this film, Jonathan saves Snow's life. The first time, he takes an arrow for her in the woods. The second time, he kisses her to awake her from the apple curse.

     The movie also opens and closes with the iconic Snow White story book from the original movie.

     The songs are amazing! Waiting on a Wish is without a doubt the best song the company has realsed in years. It has that magical quality about it that I only feel in their old songs.

     My only complaint about this film is the removal of Someday My Prince Will Come and With A Smile And A Song. I loved these two songs from the original movie and was disappointed when I didn't hear them in the remake.

     Overall, I would consider this the best live action remake they have made thus far. I would even go as far as to say that this remake is better than the original!

The classic 1937 Disney animated film, while groundbreaking for its time, hinges on a passive protagonist whose primary virtue is her beauty, waiting idly for rescue by a prince she barely knows. This lack of agency feels painfully archaic in a modern context, where audiences crave characters with depth and initiative. Subsequent adaptations, like the 2012 ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" tried to inject grit and action but ended up bogged down by a convoluted plot and an over reliance on CGI spectacle over substance. The core story struggles to resonate when its central figure lacks the complexity to carry a feature-length narrative.
The supporting cast doesn’t fare much better. The seven dwarfs, meant to provide comic relief and heart, often come across as one-note caricatures rather than fully realized characters. In the original Disney version, their individual quirks—Grumpy, Sleepy, Dopey, etc.—are memorable but shallow, existing more as gimmicks than as meaningful contributors to the story. Later renditions, like the 2012 film, either sidelined them or awkwardly forced them into a darker tone that clashed with their inherent silliness. This leaves the ensemble feeling like a missed opportunity, unable to elevate the film beyond its simplistic fairy-tale roots.
Then there’s the villain problem. The Evil Queen, with her jealousy-driven vendetta, has potential as a compelling antagonist, but she’s too often reduced to a cartoonish stereotype. In the 1937 film, her menace is undercut by melodramatic flourishes that make her more laughable than threatening. Modern takes, such as Charlize Theron’s over-the-top portrayal in ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" lean hard into camp but lack the nuance to make her a truly chilling force. A story this thin needs a standout villain to carry it, and Snow White’s iterations consistently fail to deliver one that’s both menacing and believable.
Pacing and tone also drag the experience down. The Disney classic, at a lean 83 minutes, still feels padded with musical numbers that charm but don’t advance the plot—like ""Heigh-Ho"" or ""Someday My Prince Will Come""—making it drag for anyone over the age of six. Conversely, the 2012 adaptation stretches to over two hours, bloating a simple tale with unnecessary subplots and brooding atmosphere that suffocate its fairy-tale charm. Neither version finds a rhythm that balances the story’s light and dark elements, leaving viewers either bored or overwhelmed.
Ultimately, ""Snow White"" sucks because it’s a relic that struggles to justify its relevance. The premise of a damsel in distress saved by a kiss from a near-stranger clashes with contemporary values of empowerment and consent, and attempts to modernize it often feel forced or half-baked. Its characters lack the depth to sustain emotional investment, and its execution—whether whimsical or gritty—rarely finds a cohesive voice. What worked as a Brothers Grimm tale or a 1930s novelty doesn’t hold up under scrutiny today, leaving ""Snow White"" as a pretty but hollow shell of a story that’s been outgrown by its audience.","You and 75 other people found this helpful.","75 people found this helpful."

It wasn't visually breathtaking, emotionally rich, and a wildly entertaining adventure that speaks to absolutely no one alike.

A Great Depression to Disney
One of my biggest concerns was whether the film would honor the source material while still offering something unique—and it was absolutely proven to be false. The world-building is CGI. Every fake tree, every fake animal, everything feels like it leapt right out of the world of a heartless company's imagination and into a fully unrealized cinematic universe. The devotion to detail is terrible—from the not so classic sound effects (yes, the sound effects still made me cry in horrid) to the way characters actually do absolutely nothing as they go.

The storyline is a brilliant fusion of unfunny humor, and not heartfelt emotion. Without giving too much away, it follows a worthless diverse group of characters—some beloved and some placed completely into CGI's waste bin—on an epic mission to save their realm from a massive threat. The film balances explosive action with genuine emotional beats, giving each character room to grow. And yes, there are tons of clever Easter eggs and callbacks that will make longtime players smile.

Incredible Voice Work and Characters That Shine
The voice acting is top-notch. The actor behind Steve gives a performance full of nuance—tough, kind-hearted, and heroic. The rest of the cast brings energy, warmth, and wit to the screen, from a scene-stealing parrot companion to a layered, memorable villain. Even the mobs—zombies, skeletons, and the fearsome Ender Dragon—have unique moments that feel fresh and exciting.

Visually Dazzling – Minecraft Like You’ve Never Seen It
The animation strikes a perfect balance between the game’s iconic blocky style and cinematic flair. From the gentle shimmer of light through forests to explosive battles that send blocks flying everywhere, the visuals are jaw-dropping. The Nether, in particular, is a breathtaking spectacle—both mesmerizing and menacing.

A Soundtrack That Elevates Every Moment
The music is a gorgeous blend of classic Minecraft motifs and epic orchestral scores. Familiar melodies are reimagined with cinematic depth, making every scene feel grander and more emotional. The sound design—from mining clinks to the roar of General Chungus—is immersive and pitch-perfect. And yes, Steve’s songs are genuinely moving. I didn’t expect to tear up during “Flint and Steel!” but here we are.

When I heard about a live-action adaptation, I was excited to see how they would reimagine this classic story—both for those of us who grew up with Disney princesses and for the younger generations just being introduced to them.

However, my excitement quickly faded after hearing Rachel Zegler’s repeated criticisms of the original film. She called it outdated, described it as weird and scary with a ""stalker"" vibe, and dismissed Snow White’s dream of true love, stating that in this version, she would focus on becoming a strong leader who doesn’t need to be saved. In other words, Zegler believed Snow White should have a leadership arc rather than a love story. Her remarks completely ruined my anticipation for the movie before I even had the chance to watch it.  

And after seeing the film, I felt that the live-action adaptation disrespected the original. Snow White is, at its core, a fairy tale about love, kindness, and hope—values that shouldn’t be discarded. Strength comes in many forms, and young girls should see that being gentle and kind doesn’t make you weak. Love is one of the most powerful qualities a person can have, and sadly, that essence was lost in this remake.

That being said, I have to acknowledge that Zegler’s singing is beautiful, and I love her vocals. But Snow White has always been known for her soft, delicate voice, which gives her such a unique charm. Making her belt like Elsa or even Moana takes away that special tone that defines her character. It felt like an attempt to modernize something that didn’t need changing.  
 
Of course, this is just my perspective. I went into the movie with an open mind, hoping for the best. But in the end, I believe this adaptation could have been handled better by having the right actors/actresses who truly respect the original story and its timeless message.","You and 127 other people found this helpful.","127 people found this helpful."

The musical numbers might save it for some, but the narrative itself is so disjointed and uninspired that it’s hard to stay invested. Snow White’s rise to power and her takedown of the Evil Queen feel rushed and unearned, leaving little emotional impact.

Characters and Relationships: The absence of the traditional prince is replaced by a bland ""bandit guy,"" whose chemistry with Snow White is nonexistent. Their interactions feel awkward and forced, with Snow White repeatedly saving him in scenes that come off as more ridiculous than empowering. Her portrayal as a leader often feels entitled rather than inspiring, especially when she barges into a home, commandeers someone’s bed, and bosses the dwarves around. It’s a far cry from the kindness and grace that define the Snow White we know and love.

Visuals and CGI: Oh, the CGI. Where do I even begin? It’s an absolute disaster. The seven dwarves, a cornerstone of the original tale, are rendered in such a grotesque and lifeless way that it’s almost offensive. The film’s visual tone is equally jarring—dark, soulless, and utterly devoid of the whimsy and charm that Disney is known for. The decision to split the dwarves and the bandits into separate groups only adds to the confusion, creating a visual and narrative mess that’s hard to overlook.

Acting: This is where the film truly falls apart. The performances are painfully lackluster. Gal Gadot, as the Evil Queen, delivers her lines with all the depth of a cardboard cutout. Rachel Zegler, while a talented singer, struggles to bring any emotional weight to her role as Snow White. And Jonathan (whose character name I can’t even remember) is so forgettable that he might as well not have been in the movie at all. The lack of chemistry between the cast is palpable, making every interaction feel hollow and unconvincing.

Romance: The so-called ""love story"" is a complete letdown. There’s no spark, no buildup, no emotional connection—just a series of awkward moments that fail to convince us that these characters care for each other. It’s hard to root for a romance when it feels so forced and lifeless.

In summary, this adaptation of Snow White is a frustrating misstep. While it might have a few redeeming qualities, the poor acting, disastrous CGI, and lack of romantic chemistry make it a painful watch. It’s a far cry from the magic and charm of the original, and a disappointing addition to Disney’s live-action lineup.","You and 1246 other people found this helpful.","1246 people found this helpful."

The well-judged editing and song / plot ratio helped to keep this film moving. Costume is well arranged with rich, fine embroidery and demonstrating the period integrity. Music was appropriate in style and very well crafted. There was a serious and even sinister element but not devoid of a dry sense of humour occasionally sprinkled into the text. The original 1937 Walt Disney film was evident to some extent as a few back drops and interaction with forest animals showed much similarity. The story flowed and was well done, it afforded a fresh perspective and spoke of morals, hidden gems of wisdom and conflict and resolution in one's own world.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

I just finished watching this movie and i got to say, all of the forced hate and trolls surrounding this movie is absolutely absurd because this movie wasn't even THAT bad.

I guess the styling for mostly Snow White looked a little bit odd but other  than that the film looked phenomenal!

I do understand the drama between Disney not casting real people with dwarfism to play the seven dwarfs, and it is kinda disappointing but at the same time the CGI doesn't look THAT bad and the gorgeous sets do make up for it.

The music though was INSANELY GOOD! Probably the best part of the whole film, they all were well produced, sang, and just very musically appealing. My favorites would probably be ""Waiting on a Wish"" and ""Snow White Returns"".

They were definitely moments in the film where I felt it could've been better, also I heard how Gal Gadot's acting sucked but honestly it wasn't even THAT bad, I guess there were some scenes were her acting felt kinda weird and offplace but to be honest majority of her scenes weren't half bad. I just wished they made her makeup look much more evil and like the original.

Overall, if you have good attention span or your just a big Disney Princess fan (like me) then this movie is for you!
It has a good blend of musical and fairytail, with a story that expands the Snow White universe and music that will either make you want to SING, DANCE, OR EVEN CRY (im totally not the last one).

For me this movie was a solid 4 / 5.
I definitely expected to trash talk this movie but for some reason I absolutely LOVED it!
Anyways, that's just my honest review about this movie.","You and 11 other people found this helpful.","11 people found this helpful."

The story is both heartwarming and thrilling, balancing moments of joy, suspense, and genuine emotion.

It’s a film that captures the essence of classic fairy tales while delivering a powerful message about love, friendship, and the triumph of good over evil. Every moment is crafted with care, making it one of the greatest animated films of all time.

Disney built his legacy on storytelling that transported audiences to a world of wonder, reinforcing themes of kindness, resilience, and the pursuit of dreams. This new adaptation, however, strips away the heart of the original tale, replacing it with forced modern sensibilities that feel disingenuous rather than inspiring.

Walt Disney believed in the power of fairy tales to teach valuable lessons through well-developed characters and timeless narratives. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a groundbreaking film, carefully crafted with beautiful animation, memorable songs, and a simple yet meaningful story about love, hope, and inner goodness. This remake seems to abandon those core themes, instead prioritizing revisions that undermine what made Snow White so beloved for generations. By changing essential elements—whether it be character dynamics, the portrayal of Snow White herself, or the very message of the story—Disney is disregarding the very principles that built its reputation as the pinnacle of animation and family entertainment.

Additionally, this film is part of a growing trend where Disney revises its classics under the guise of progress but ends up alienating longtime fans while failing to capture new ones. The original Snow White left an everlasting impact on children and adults alike, creating a sense of nostalgia and wonder that has endured for nearly a century. Instead of honoring that legacy, this adaptation diminishes it, leaving behind a film that feels hollow and disconnected from the heart of what made Disney great in the first place. It’s disappointing to see a company that once prided itself on storytelling excellence now prioritize corporate messaging over timeless magic.","You and 63 other people found this helpful.","63 people found this helpful."

In contrast, the 2025 live-action remake has faced significant criticism, underperforming both critically and commercially.​

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen has been widely panned, with critics describing her performance as lacking menace and depth, rendering the character more comical than intimidating. The decision to depict the Seven Dwarfs using CGI has also drawn negative attention, with some viewers finding the digital renditions unsettling and lacking the expressiveness of the animated originals. ​Roger Ebert

Furthermore, attempts to modernize elements of the story, such as reimagining the Prince character into a bandit leader named Jonathan, have been met with mixed reactions. While intended to provide Snow White with a more active role, this change resulted in a romance subplot that felt underdeveloped and lacked emotional depth. ​

Visually, the film's over-reliance on CGI contributed to a ""fake-looking"" aesthetic, detracting from the immersive experience. In contrast, the original 1937 film's hand-drawn animation, compelling characterizations, and memorable music have ensured its enduring legacy.​

In conclusion, while the 1937 ""Snow White"" remains a celebrated classic, the 2025 remake struggles to capture the magic and depth of its predecessor. The critiques surrounding the film's performances, visual choices, and narrative alterations suggest that some stories are best left untouched, preserving the charm and authenticity that made them beloved in the first place","You and 7 other people found this helpful.","7 people found this helpful."

This movie not only exemplifies these valuable qualities a fairytale entails but it is applicable to TODAY’S children. As many people have forgotten, these movies are mostly made with children in mind. That being said, I am in no way discouraging those over twelve from enjoying these types of movies because they are enjoyable for all ages.

As a literary buff, I am impressed with the double meaning posed by the word “fair”. Fairness applies to both beauty and empathy in this sense which truly encapsulates the whole point of this tale to begin with.

This is not the 1930s any longer, and women of today’s age aren’t only looking for a happily ever after in a husband and a family. This movie provides the truth of standing up for yourself, as the heroine learns how to grow into her own skills and trust in her abilities. Confidence, a skill so lacking in today’s world. Rachel Zegler’s ability to act as both a kind hearted princess and a strong leader is admirable and inspiring to all children looking for that extra boost of confidence.

As for the music- both the classics and the new tunes were enjoyable to listen to. I especially loved “Waiting on a Wish”, a very relatable song for all of us daydreamers hoping for something more. I myself am a big fan of Rachel’s voice in particular, but also Gal Gadot’s villain songs were deliciously devilish, reminiscent to the classic songs of the past animated films.

For those of you who whine about character accuracy to the original description- coming from someone involved in theatre, I will say that the casting directors shouldn’t be looking for a lead based on his/her/their looks but rather if they encompass the character- being able to sing is also a bonus in this case. Beauty standards in the 21st century are not the same as in the time the original Grimm tales were written, and frankly it’s disgusting watching so many people be so caught up on the descriptions of someone’s skin. 

As for the four stars- I do admit that this movie did seem rushed in the plot line, however I understand this is common in many movies. It gave a sort of aspect of a movie based on a book, where it felt that something was missing, though it hit all the plot lines.

I truly would recommend this movie, as it embodies what a modernized fairytale should look like in accordance to our time and our ideals. To those die hard fans of the original Snow White- yes it isn’t like the 1937 version, but also neither are we. Romantic love is no longer the only motivation for heroines- I know, hold your gasps and shocked faces. Remember that the 1937 movie is also not the original- and many of you wouldn’t appreciate the Grimm tale that bases both movies.","You and 76 other people found this helpful.","76 people found this helpful."

I also saw a lot of comments criticizing the costume design, especially Snow White’s dress. But people seem to miss the fact that Disney intentionally adjusts the colors in live-action versions. They often oversaturate the princess costumes so they translate well to merchandise, like the dresses kids buy. And as far as the hair it's the same situation, they want to try and keep it simple and replicable -- something they failed to do with Cinderella, but fixed afterwards in the Beauty and the Beast remake. It’s a practical design choice, not a mistake. And honestly, it’s a children’s movie—kids aren’t sitting there comparing color palettes and hair style to the original cartoon.

Its Not your typical princess story, with a prince that saves the day. Its more to it, than you think

The movie explores the profound notion that inner beauty transcends physical appearance, emphasizing the value of inner virtues(beauty) such as love, kindness, fairness, truth, and justice. In a society we live in today, We are increasingly consumed by materialism and superficiality, the concept of inner beauty often remains elusive, much like the evil queen's obsession with vanity. The story illustrates that true beauty is not defined by fleeting physical traits but by possessing the enduring qualities of true ntegrity, compassion, and righteousness. Being the  ""fairest"" is not a matter of outward appearance, but of being authentically kind, just, being true to ones self and for others. It’s unfortunate that some people took their criticism and hate too far just because the main character is Latina (Tan skinned) and the controversial  issue/s surrounding the movie. Despite all of that, i am so happy with both Gal Gadot's and Rachel Zegler's performance. I will give this movie a 8.5/10! ❤👑❄🪞 

Remember the lesson of the story,  physical beauty isn't lasting it fades in time but being compassionate with a heart of Gold. You will leave a mark on others passing the same love and kindness throughout generations. A lesson that teaches our  children that true beauty  shines through our daily actions! ❤✨","You and 57 other people found this helpful.","57 people found this helpful."

BUT BOY I WAS WRONG! My mind changed the moment I saw the first trailer, that the story was about standing up to tyrants, listenining to the people and be who you are meant to be. I watched last Wednesday, and I am so glad I did. The movie is what we need in these times to encourage ourselves to not be silent when we see injustice; Snow White in this film was silenced by the Evil Queen but she was encouraged to speak when Jonathan told her about the situation outside the palace walls. 

Rachel Zegler’s “Waiting on a Wish” begs us to take action rather staying idle and waiting for our dreams to happen; this really made me cry, for I can relate- I should have moved out of this country a long time ago- and waking up to the same situation beckons me to strive harder for my dreams and not just wait for things to change.

The evil Queen represented dictators and politicians who are using cheap magic tricks and entertainment to allure the people to support and be controled by them- reminded me of budot dancing political campaign and how the Duterte and Marcoses make vlogs rather than discuss platforms and how vote buying is rampant.

I love Snow White, Jonathan’s and Dopey’s character developments too. And my friend was also one of the actors who helped brought the Dwarves to life. 

The Snow White remake reminded us that the real power of any government form is from the people and we need to acknowledge that. This snow helped her people regain their freedom from the Evil Queen’s control and finally became the leader her father wanted her to be- which made me cry again since I can relate as a public servants’ son and grandson- my mother is an elected Vice Mayor; and she raised me to always be mindful of other people’s needs. 

In conclusion, do not be discouraged from the drama and the casting from watching this film, it will encourage you to take action. Rachel was perfect since this Snow needed to be passionate and fierce; and fairness in this version is not about beauty but being admired and just. The Queen was most admired because of her Magic Tricks; but when the whispers of Snow trying to better the situation of her people spread- her popularity outshone the Queen’s.

One of my favorite scenes in the movie was the climax when it did show how unique way of dealing with the evil queen, And how deeply Snow White remembered her subjects fondly no matter how small they were. 

Needless to say, if you hadn’t already, please go see it for yourself. It is a really good movie.","You and 22 other people found this helpful.","22 people found this helpful."

This film is a complete disaster from start to finish, with wooden acting, horrendous CGI, and a script that sucks out any charm or magic from the original fairytale.

The acting is one of the biggest letdowns. Rachel Zegler, who plays Snow White, delivers an incredibly bland and lifeless performance. She lacks the innocence and warmth that made the original character so beloved. Her line delivery feels forced, as if she’s just reading off a script with no emotional depth. The chemistry between her and other characters is nonexistent, making interactions feel awkward and unconvincing.

Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen had the potential to shine, but even she couldn’t save this mess. Instead of a truly menacing villain, she comes across as a one-dimensional caricature. Her performance jumps between over-the-top theatrics and dull moments, never finding the right balance.

Then there’s the CGI—easily some of the worst I’ve seen in a big-budget film. The environments look artificial, the animals are creepy and unrealistic, and the so-called “magical creatures” replacing the dwarfs are an absolute joke. Their designs are ugly, and their presence feels completely unnecessary. Even the Magic Mirror scene, which should have been visually stunning, looks like a low-budget video game cutscene. Every frame screams fake, making it impossible to immerse yourself in the story.

Speaking of the story, the writing is another major issue. The dialogue is painfully modern and out of place in a fairytale setting. The film strips away the heartwarming themes of love, kindness, and friendship, replacing them with a dull, preachy message that feels forced rather than inspiring. Snow White is no longer the kind and gentle character we remember—here, she’s rewritten as a rebellious leader who doesn’t need anyone. Strong female characters are great when written well, but this version of Snow White comes across as arrogant and unlikable, making it hard to root for her.

The magic and wonder of the original Snow White are completely lost. Instead of a timeless fairytale, we get a soulless corporate remake that fails in every aspect. From the lifeless performances to the abysmal CGI and uninspired writing, this is one of the worst live-action adaptations Disney has ever made.

I wouldn’t recommend this movie to anyone—whether you love the original or just enjoy good cinema, this will only leave you frustrated.","You and 835 other people found this helpful.","835 people found this helpful."

I think it's important to separate the troubles of the real world from the beauty of the imaginary. I never let a controversy surrounding an actor sway my view of a character or a film, because regardless of the person, the film may still be an incredible piece of art to experience. Plenty of artists in all lines of work have levels of controversy surrounding them. We wouldn't have gotten the original Iron Man without the controversial Robert Downey Jr. I could go on to list plenty of examples, as I'm sure could many others. But prefaces aside, let's discuss the actual content of the film. The first thing I'll say is This is not snow white. It is a complete recoloring and redesign of the original story, both brothers grim and the original disney film It genuinely feels like Disney used the name purely as a cash grab. Well let's say that we take out the fact that it's SUPPOSED to be snow white, as I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible If I had never seen or read the original Well the film still has a menagerie of blatant issues 1. The CGI I really wanted to give this film a chance, but the graphics in this film are so uncanny in the most uncomfortable way The dwarves just look completely out of.place and actually take away from the ""magic"" of the movie The animals also lack an amount of realism, and it seems like dosney couldn't decide if it wanted to be more realistic or fantastic and you just end up with an unsettling mix of artistic decisions 2. The acting Though both Gadot and Ziegler had redeeming moments through the film, a lot of their performance fell flat with me. Especially when interacting with eachother. The lines felt robotic and unnatural. And the surrounding cast also seemed to be more suited for a stage play than an actual film. The best performance in my mind came from the dearest, who i simply couldn't invest in due to their unsettling appearences 3. The politics As I said earlier, I think it's important to separate the real world from the imaginary And while I understand that films as art can be and often are used to portray particular messages, i feel like this film was explicitly created to send a political message that just didn't sit right with me The general politics of the world that this film takes place in are very communistic, and without spoiling too much, seems to me to be attempting to tell the viewers that the best possible way that we can all live happily, what will make someone the ""fairest of them all"" is to live in a communal society that decides everything amongst eachother ""fairly and evenly"" and really tries to drive this point home All in all, I can say that the movie genuinely made me uncomfortable Even when removing all of the external controversies and politics Its not something that was enjoyable for me","You and 13 other people found this helpful.","13 people found this helpful."

A  daring and fiery  adaptation which was all the more magical with the cinematic use of CGI on the dwarfs. Admittedly it throws out the romantic aspect of the fairytale, but she still finds love albeit in a very weird way. 

It's sad her parents die.  In Grimm fairytale version the evil queen is her biological mother !? Yikes ... I think it's much more believable to think she's her stepmother ...
What I loved was the brave and strong quality that this snow white was given.  She was definitely her father's daughter and made him proud as a heroine of her people in the end! 
A feminist version of Snow white ??
Well I love that modern attribute to the character! I am a MAGA FEMINIST! So let's be real ...life for women today is no fairy tale.  As  a modern day remake, it appeals to  empowerment of women who don't depend on a man for  happiness. This snow white is a warrior who will dare to defeat evil forces that oppress her.

What I didn't like was the prince was a thief  (with greasy looking hair) ...but his mob stole out of necessity since they were so poor so he was a Robinhood type ...still we would want to believe he's of better character than that ...let's not glamorize the thug life . 
So beautifully worked cinematically ...especially the queens outfits.  I think the Zegler was a good modern character for this ...her skin is not ivory but she exuded enough innocence to endear her to an audience and lend universal appeal.

I'm not a big Disney fan or musicals fan in general but I give credit where it's due.  If anything the musical parts were lacking because Zegler can't hit high notes a titular Snow White must  hit.  A bad choice of actress for this movie and it's  a pity","You and 13 other people found this helpful.","13 people found this helpful."

The 2025 live-action adaptation of Snow White was always going to face an uphill battle, trying to balance the charm of the 1937 animated masterpiece with modern societal perspectives. Despite being aware of the controversy surrounding the film, I approached it with an open mind, aiming to enjoy it for what it was.

Singing and Music: 
The film leans heavily into its musical aspect, perhaps a bit too much for my personal taste. That being said, Rachel Zegler’s singing voice is undeniably beautiful, and I’m sure many will appreciate the vocal talent on display. Personally, I found the frequent songs disrupted the flow of the story rather than enhancing it.

Plot and Storytelling:
The plot stumbles along with a strong-willed Snow White attempting to convince her wicked stepmother following the tragic loss of both her parents that the Queen should share her wealth with their suffering subjects, just as the King did. This concept, although noble, comes off as muddled when the Queen responds that the people want a diamond instead of a rose. I'm sure they would, oh and an apple pie. (Not the McDonald's variety but I can guarantee you're thinking of one right now)

Characters and Performances:
Gal Gadot, although undeniably a contender for “fairest of them all,” lacks the menacing presence needed for the Evil Queen. Her portrayal, with wild-eyed antics and a bumbling song piece, makes her come across more like a petulant spouse than a genuinely sinister antagonist. A Miss Trunchbull type character would have been far more menacing.

Snow White’s encounter with the film’s stand-in for the classic prince, a Robin Hood-type character caught pinching potatoes from the palace, feels forced and awkward. After being caught and randomly tied to a gate for a few minutes, Snow White quickly frees him, and he scarpers back to the forest.

CGI and Visual Effects:
The CGI portrayal of the dwarfs has stirred controversy, particularly among the dwarfism community, but as far as technical quality goes, it’s just standard CGI, nothing exceptionally good or bad. It doesn’t look out of place, the dwarves were likeable characters though it certainly doesn’t evoke the magic of the original animated film.

Supporting Characters:
Instead of the traditional prince, we get a vagabond, Robin Hood-type hero leading a politically correct group of merry men and women of all shapes and sizes, fighting in the late king’s name. It’s a bit confusing, trying to convey that Snow White doesn’t need a knight in shining armor yet he takes an arrow for her (not a euphemism). Unfortunately, 
despite nearing death, she doesn’t even notice until one of the merry people, points it out later. Thank God they did or we may have never got the cheesy Boyzone manifested cringe fest song at the end of the scene. 

Final Thoughts:
The film hits most of the classic story beats, dwarfs, a poisoned apple, and true love’s kiss, however the final moments, however, feel weak and unfulfilling, as though the film doesn’t quite know how to tie up the loose ends.

In the end, Snow White (2025) is an ambitious attempt to modernise a beloved tale, but it often falls flat, leaving audiences with a muddled plot, awkward character dynamics, and an overall sense of missed potential.","You and 309 other people found this helpful.","309 people found this helpful."

To me in some regard this dishonors the very foundation of Disney. And almost any ""Live action version"". Why are we taking nostalgia and compiling it with real actors and actresses and removing the animation aspect?  

It amazes me that there are people (Disney Adults) out their who praise, eat, sleep, and live on Disney (In it's current state going as far as 2015 ""Being generous""). to attend to every little disney event and blow it up on social media.  And as a way for Disney to say thanks for spending 10s of thousands of dollars on us. They give to you a live action slop film of some kind. Such as Snow White.  

TLDR: As a 90s kid growing up looking at Disney during some of the best films they've released. All animated mind you. It shows that Animation from the 1990s (NOT CGI) still surpasses modern day films. In all categories.","You and 477 other people found this helpful.","477 people found this helpful."

One thing I really liked about this adaptation was that we got to see what Snow's relationship with her stepmother, the Evil Queen, was like.  How Snow White walked a fine line between respect and fear of the Queens temper.

Gal Gadot playing the Evil Queen was just amazing, a woman who was so obsessed with the idea of perfection she couldn't see what real beauty is. The total opposite of Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman.  In the animated film, from the first scene you could see that the Queen has a very loose grip on her temper.  However in the live-action, we visibly see the Queens obsession in her face, her words, clothes and movements.  All of which get progressively worse until she turns into the old hag. The ending to the Queen's story: Wow, just wow.

Like many people I was hoping they could cast live actors for the dwarves, but I have to admit I did enjoy the personalities of the characters once they were introduced.

The songs were very good, I thought ""Waiting on a Wish"" was a wonderful homage to the Disney classic ""I'm Wishing"".  Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work are still as catchy as ever. Just when I thought I would never hear another Disney love song again, I hear ""A Hand Meets a Hand""; I could listen to that everyday on repeat.

Snow White 2025, in my opinion, is one of the better adaptations of Disney along with Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast. Just give it a chance.","You and 21 other people found this helpful.","21 people found this helpful."

Multiple generations, millions up to billions of people supported Disney for decades going as far back to the last century.
The big reason why people are aggitated over this remake is because it is very clear how much they don't give a damn about the original movie. How they don't care about Walt's wishes to protect the original movie. As a result, also disrespected the whole of media and the animation community, as Snow White's existence made it possible for our beloved animations to exist as well.

Disney is extremely foolish to think this movie was EVER going to be a success. Rachel Zegler is highly unprofessional, entitled, and lacks class. People who doesn't see Snow White as anything more than a a boring kid's movie have no right to speak as they clearly don't understand why this is a big deal to many people.

Snow White is a classic, the birth of animation, the beacon of hope for the people at the time it was made, it deserved respect. Disney shows how much they truly don't give a shit over something that matters so much to so many people. The extreme disrespect and these attempts to tarnish what people loved for decades is why people have been up and arms against Disney. There is a reason they are defensive.

As for the movie itself, all the actors are horrendously bad. The CGI is so disgustingly ugly. Dumbo remake failed, that should've been a sign to Disney that this cgi nonsense was BS. THE DRESS IS HORRIBLE. And the maker was the same as Cinderella? The message is pathetic. Every change they made was bullshit. Cottagecore, elegance, friendship, fairytale love, and femininity has been on the rise. The original movie would've worked so well in this modern age despite the slightly boring and calm segments. Cinderella remake was gorgeous and wasn't a carbon copy of the first original, they couldn't have remake something like that?

And there are fools out there who thinks this regurgitated mess is good? 

Seriously, WHAT HAPPENED with this company? Disappointment after disappointment. What made them think that this was ever going to be a success? It's so embarrassing. Sure they made terrible cash grab flops before especially with the sequels of renaissance movies, but atleast those didn't cost hundreds of millions each to make.","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

The prince ain’t even show up ’cause he probably saw the rough cut and dipped.

The visuals looked like a bad Zoom filter, the pacing was slower than DMV lines, and the only magic mirror here is the one Disney used to lie to themselves sayin’ this was a good idea.

And the moral of the story? Apparently, “Be bitter, talk condescending, and never smile.” They took a fairy tale and turned it into a damn TED Talk with zero joy. My 4-year-old would’ve walked out confused and pissed, and he watches Cocomelon.

This movie made me reconsider all my life choices, including why I didn’t walk out halfway through. If I had to sum it up: Disney tried to “modernize” a classic, but all they did was commit first-degree character assassination on the whole damn story.

Would rather get roasted by my ex’s group chat.

5/5 – A Giant Green Masterpiece of Chaos

Ah yes, Shrek — the cinematic event that made us all question why a Scottish ogre, a talking donkey, and a karaoke-loving dragon somehow work better than most romantic comedies. Who knew that swamp life, flatulence, and passive-aggressive fairytale creatures could create one of the most iconic animated films of all time?

The dialogue? Pure gold. The humor? So layered it hits kids, teens, and adults all at once — and somehow gets funnier with age (or maybe we just got more bitter and now relate to Shrek). Eddie Murphy’s Donkey is basically the chaotic best friend we all need, and Fiona? A literal princess who can throw hands and turn into an ogre? Iconic.

The soundtrack deserves its own award. You can’t tell me you hear “All Star” without picturing Shrek bursting out of the outhouse. Peak cinema.

Let’s be honest — Shrek didn’t just entertain us, it raised us. A five-star fever dream we never asked for but desperately needed.","You and 6 other people found this helpful.","6 people found this helpful."

The film’s stunning cinematography and lush CGI create a magical world that pulls you in from the first frame. The music is beautifully composed, elevating every scene and adding emotional depth to the story. Disney has truly outdone itself with this live-action remake — it’s enchanting, inspiring, and utterly captivating.

If you’re looking for a movie that’ll leave you feeling uplifted and amazed, look no further. “Snow White” is a perfect blend of fantasy, heart, and adventure. Five stars all the way!","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

Totally thought Snow White was gonna end up with Dopey or the  flower crown girl (I've seeing too much flower crown Yuri) in the first half of the movie. Still, (SPOILERS STARTING HERE) knock-off Flynn Rider was adequate, if not the greatest, as a love interest. Not even weird cgi can cripple the awesomeness of the dwarves. I have two major issues with the movie: the villagers and Snow White. On the former, during the revolt scene when the villagers are singing backup, their expressions are ridiculous. On one side you have a black woman who looks overjoyed to be with Snow White while on the other side you have some redhead who looks like someone punched her in the gut, and behind them, you have the most bored, disinterested group of men I've ever seen. It's really quite distracting. Now on Snow White, the costume looks kinda goofy in live action, and the actor keep making this weird quasi-smile that's really just teeth, which is odd. Other than that she also has hermit hair, but to each their own I guess. Her locket looks like one of those corny ""live, laugh, love"" lockets worn by teenage girls after fishing them out of supermarket gacha machines. I suppose we, the audience, are too stupid to understand the symbolism of the locket without it being literally written across it. Other than all that, the movie is pretty good, the music (sans princess problems) is pretty good, especially high-ho. The bandits are a cool addition to the movie, and the scene where the birds pretend to be Snow White is rad. The magic mirror has a really nice, rich voice that adds a lot value to all the scenes he's in. Overall, it's a fun movie. While there are plenty of stupid scenes (PAUL), it's plenty fun to make fun of them. In terms of live-action Disney, it's miles above little mermaid and lion king while falling just short of Aladdin. Just don't watch it in theater, lots of yelling.","You and 22 other people found this helpful.","22 people found this helpful."

If you love fairy tales, adventure, and a dash of Disney magic, Snow White is a must-see! It’s a wonderful tribute to the original while adding new layers that make it feel fresh and relevant. Highly recommend!","You and 139 other people found this helpful.","139 people found this helpful."

It’s a baffling, lifeless remake that completely misses the magic of the 1937 classic. Instead of capturing the fairy tale charm, it turns into a dull, CGI-heavy mess that feels more like a corporate checklist than an actual movie.

Let’s start with the biggest issue: the story. The film tries so hard to be modern and progressive that it forgets to be entertaining. Snow White, played by Rachel Zegler, isn’t the kind, dreamy princess we remember. Instead, she’s been reworked into a “strong female lead” in the most generic way possible—stripped of any personality beyond vague determination. And the Evil Queen? Gal Gadot is miscast, delivering a performance that feels more like a perfume commercial than a villainous powerhouse.

Then, there are the dwarfs—or rather, the lack of them. Disney’s decision to replace them with a mix of CGI characters and random human companions was controversial from the start, and it only gets worse in execution. They lack personality, they look weird, and they add absolutely nothing to the film.

Visually, this movie is a disaster. The overuse of CGI makes everything feel artificial and cheap, especially compared to the hand-drawn beauty of the original. Instead of stunning fantasy landscapes, we get flat, soulless environments that feel like they were thrown together at the last minute.

And the music? Forgettable. The new songs fail to capture the magic of Disney’s golden age, and even the classic tunes are either removed or reworked beyond recognition.

Overall, Snow White is a disaster. It’s joyless, visually unappealing, and completely unnecessary. Disney has made bad movies before, but this one feels especially soulless—like it was made by a committee that fundamentally doesn’t understand what made the original so special. If you love Snow White, do yourself a favor and skip this.

This the worst shit disney ever pooped outta their micky ass.

I swear, Snow White looks like she walked off the set of a Shrek sequel in the worst way possible. Girl’s got the “evil” vibe but, like, without the charm or, y'know, the actual evilness.

Rachel Zegler, babe, I hate to say it, but you look like you got cast as Snow White because they couldn’t afford actual CGI to make you look like a fairy tale princess. No shade, but with that facial structure, you’re giving Voldemort from Harry Potter meets Shrek’s long-lost cousin. Like, who greenlit this casting? Honestly, watching her try to be charming felt like watching someone read a script for the first time, super stiff and awkward. She’s trying to be all “strong independent woman” but instead, she just looks like someone who's lost in the woods without a GPS. No thanks.

And the dwarfs? 😭 I thought we were getting these cute, quirky little characters who are fun and lovable—nope, these are just sad versions of the originals. Instead of a bunch of personalities that actually add anything, we get... whatever this is. The whole diversity thing they were going for? Cute idea, but it ended up being so forced it felt like watching a woke version of the Lord of the Rings extras. Like, why do the dwarfs feel like they’re being awkwardly shoehorned into a plot that literally doesn’t care about them?

Let’s talk about the CGI for a second. This movie is so saturated in bad CGI, you’ll be wondering if someone accidentally pulled the plug on the budget halfway through. The magical forest looks like the kind of background you find in a 2010 mobile game, and the magic mirror is straight-up a Snapchat filter. They really thought giving us some digital nonsense would distract us from the fact that the plot is dead on arrival.

And don’t even get me started on the “romantic” vibes. Snow White and the Prince have zero chemistry. Like, it’s as if they were both told to pretend they’re in love but didn’t even try. It’s giving “we’re both getting paid to stand here,” not “true love's kiss” vibes. The original was at least cute, but this? Nope, they barely even talk to each other. Imagine trying to make a whole movie about falling in love, but the couple can’t even manage a decent convo. ✨Yikes.✨

Basically, this movie is what happens when you take a perfectly good, whimsical fairy tale and drown it in overblown CGI, bad casting, and a forced agenda. It’s an embarrassment, and I honestly regret spending two hours of my life on it. If you’re looking for a Snow White movie, just rewatch the animated one—at least that one doesn’t look like it was made in the Uncanny Valley.

As a live-action reimagining of Walt Disney's 1937 animated classic, it stays true to the original fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm while adding its own modern twist. The film stars Rachel Zegler as the titular character, with Andrew Burnap and Gal Gadot in supporting roles. The story follows Snow White as she teams up with seven dwarfs and a bandit named Jonathan to reclaim her kingdom from her wicked stepmother.

Rachel Zegler truly shines in this film. Her singing is phenomenal, and her acting captures the kind, graceful, and sweet essence of Snow White perfectly. She carried the movie on her back, outshining everyone else, including Gal Gadot. Speaking of Gadot, while her gowns were stunning, her performance fell flat. Her portrayal of the Evil Queen lacked intimidation, and her inability to sing made her musical moments more laughable than menacing. It was disappointing, especially given the potential of her character.

The dwarves were a mixed bag. While they added some charm, their portrayal felt a bit off, and it took some time to get used to them. I couldn’t help but wish real actors had been used instead, as it might have brought more heart and authenticity to their roles. Overall, the film has its moments, particularly thanks to Rachel Zegler’s standout performance, but it struggles with uneven acting and some odd creative choices. It’s worth a watch for fans of the original, but it doesn’t quite live up to the magic of the 1937 classic. A solid 3-star effort.","You and 18 other people found this helpful.","18 people found this helpful."

My favorite has always been Cinderella, but I understand why some love Snow White so much. Personally I like this movie BETTER than the original, which even reading the bad reviews most of us don’t watch often. You know why? Cause it’s BORING, plot is so simple compared to plots we have now. It is charming and still beloved because of what the movie represents, but most people were bashing the story for being awful before this movie came out and everyone decided to switch it up and climb the hate train. I bet if you sat down and rewatched the original it would put you to sleep. They barely took anything out of the plot and simply added to it. I feel this way about Sleeping Beauty as well as Aurora is literally not in most of the film, and it actually centers around Prince Philip, the good fairies, and Maleficent a lot more. It is almost a Disney Prince movie like Aladdin is rather than a Disney Princess movie, but nobody is ready to hear that. I think this movie it gave the “Prince” more depth, and over all there was just MORE to the story. Plus I thought the set design was stunning, and the message was still there. Show White is beautiful and strong because of her heart, which is stated by the mirror at the end of the film if you actually watched the movie, not cause she’s the skinniest, whitest, daintiest princess. Was that the point of the first one, yeah a little bit, but it’s not the point of this adaptation. If you are looking for a copy of the original but in live action, this movie is not it and then I can see why you were left disappointed. It’s almost like how the “book is always better when the movie” when often it’s not true they are just different and sometimes are telling different stories within the same world. We have done this since the beginning of time. Disney’s Snow White is not actually that similar to the original story as it was changed for the time it was written but most people aren’t up in arms about that. Point is, I would suggest giving this movie a CHANCE. You don’t have to like it, most people don’t even like the original that much anymore other than it’s symbolism because the story doesn’t hit like it used to, but I don’t think it’s fair to just hate it to hate it. Rachel Zegler definitely didn’t do a great job promoting the movie, and she did come off as insufferable, but she is still talented and that definitely showed. I also don’t exactly think k it’s fair to expect her to not take a JOB just cause the original Snow White wasn’t her favorite, cause again it’s not every popular let’s be real, because it’s WORK and you can’t always pick and choose. Anyway, I would suggest giving it a chance. I did and I would GENUINELY watch it again, especially over the original. People just want something to hate and Disney seems to be taking a lot of it recently.","You and 30 other people found this helpful.","30 people found this helpful."

If you thought the Evil Queen was the villain of Snow White, think again—because this film is its own worst enemy. Disney’s latest attempt at ""reimagining"" a beloved classic feels less like a fresh take and more like an uninspired, soulless cash grab with all the charm of a poisoned apple.

If you thought the Evil Queen was the villain of Snow White, think again—because this film is its own worst enemy. Disney’s latest attempt at ""reimagining"" a beloved classic feels less like a fresh take and more like an uninspired, soulless cash grab with all the charm of a poisoned apple.

First, let’s talk about the script—if you can even call it that. The dialogue feels like it was written by a committee of corporate executives who have never had a conversation in their lives. Gone are the heartwarming moments of the original, replaced by forced, cringeworthy lines that make you wonder if the writers were allergic to sincerity.

Then, there’s the casting. While talent should always come before nostalgia, it’s clear that whoever was in charge of this film forgot to hire actors who could actually, you know, act. The lead performance is flatter than a piece of parchment, making Snow White’s journey less of a fairy tale and more of a test of audience endurance. The supporting cast? Equally lifeless. The dwarfs (if you can even call them that anymore) are reduced to background noise, their once-distinct personalities erased in favor of bland, forgettable placeholders.

The CGI is another disaster. Instead of enchanting visuals, we get a mix of plastic-looking landscapes and unconvincing creatures that feel like they were borrowed from a failed 2010s video game. The magic mirror looks like an Instagram filter gone wrong, and the forest scenes are so artificially lit they might as well have been shot in a supermarket.

And the music—oh, the horror. Disney musicals used to be legendary, but this soundtrack sounds like it was cobbled together in a rush by someone who just discovered auto-tune. There’s not a single memorable tune, and every song feels like it was included just to check a box.

Worst of all, the film seems to have no idea what made Snow White special in the first place. Instead of embracing timeless storytelling, it tries to shove in modern messages with all the grace of a sledgehammer. Yes, stories should evolve with the times, but when the updates feel this forced and out of place, it just comes off as condescending rather than inspiring.

In the end, Snow White (2025) is proof that not every classic needs a remake—especially not one this poorly executed. The magic is gone, the heart is missing, and the only wish I had after watching it was to get those two hours of my life back. If Walt Disney could see this, he’d probably take one bite of that poisoned apple himself.

Additionally, Dopey came across as more of a creepy man-child than the lovable character we all know and love. It feels as though Disney has completely lost touch with what made their original stories so magical. I understand the desire to introduce new Disney princesses and strong female characters, but many of us still cherish the classics where the prince saves the princess, and they live happily ever after.

I’m really frustrated with how every new movie seems to change the iconic looks and outfits of beloved characters. The blame seems to be placed on Rachel for the film not resonating with audiences, but honestly, it felt like a complete disaster overall, even if they had cast someone who looked the part better the film still would have been a massive flop from disney changing the story and it being so incredibly boring.","You and 6 other people found this helpful.","6 people found this helpful."

Disney has to questions where the money gone into because there is a serious corruption inside the company. 

The plot is can not be sillier. There is no prince, instead we have a theft. And the “cruel queen” just tied him up at the gate when even a child can go an recuse him. The “truthful” mirror turn out to tell lie all the time. A princess with a face look more evil than the queen. And the queen is just try so hard to be look like evil. Their roles should be reversed. And everyone’s acting are terrible, Gal Gardot’s acting is a better than all of them. But it’s still bad.

The original “diversity people” were recasted as the prince’s crew. But inside that crew, there is a dwarf. So what the hell of those 7 creatures that Snow White met except nightmares ? And we a have fight scene that look worse than any fight scene ever made in film history. I remember how excited I am with fight scenes in Disney movie, but not this one. 

The ending is like it was written by a 5 years old child. They try to be deep, but it has nothing more than silly. Snow White simply change the soldiers mind by saying their name. I mean they don’t even have a reason to be loyal with the queen in the first place. In every versions, the Hunter is a stranger, a  sidekick or a relative of the queen. In this version, The Hunter even has been serving the old royal family for so many years. Now the queen just say something and then he wants to kill the princess that he helps raising for all of those years ? That doesn’t make any sense.

The movie is a waste of time and energy. It’s doesn’t worth with the budget $300 million dollars. And It doesn’t worth any of your single penny.","You and 40 other people found this helpful.","40 people found this helpful."

My Review: Disney’s Live-Action Snow White

Disney’s latest live-action adaptation of Snow White takes bold creative liberties, delivering a visually stunning yet divisive reimagining of the classic tale. While it retains the heart of the original, it also introduces significant changes—some more welcome than others.

One of the most striking departures is the Evil Queen’s fate. Rather than the traditional comeuppance, she is consumed by her own magic, pulled into the mirror’s realm after shattering it in a fit of rage. This ending is unlike any previous iteration, and while intriguing, it will take some time for me to fully embrace it. It certainly leaves room for speculation—could this be setting up a sequel?

The film leans heavily into its musical elements, but I found the number of songs excessive. If they had been trimmed down by half, the pacing might have felt tighter. At times, the film’s momentum slowed under the weight of too many musical sequences.

Performance-wise, Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot both did well with the material they were given. Zegler embodies Snow White’s innocence and charm, while Gadot’s Evil Queen is delightfully theatrical. However, I personally preferred the more dramatic, serious portrayals of Charlize Theron and Kristen Stewart in Snow White and the Huntsman. Theron’s intensity as the Queen set a high bar for live-action adaptations, one that this film doesn’t quite match in terms of gravitas.

That said, one undeniable highlight was Gadot’s costuming. Every outfit she wore was simply breathtaking, elevating her presence as the Evil Queen even further. The costume design in general was exceptional, bringing a regal, fairy-tale elegance to the screen. I cannot wait to get the 2 live-action Evil Queen dolls, a 12 and 17 inches, of Gal in the costumes.

Overall, while Snow White has its strengths—strong performances, stunning visuals, and a unique (if polarizing) take on the story—the film's pacing issues and the drastic changes to the original tale keep it from being a masterpiece. I give it a 7/10.

This live-action remake takes a classic fairy tale and drowns it in a swamp of clunky CGI, forced modernization, and a tone so inconsistent it feels like the movie’s having an identity crisis mid-scene. Rachel Zegler tries her best as Snow White, and her voice is admittedly gorgeous, but she’s stuck delivering lines that swing between preachy empowerment speeches and awkward attempts at charm—neither of which land. Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen is all style and no substance; she slinks around in fabulous costumes but can’t muster the menace or depth to make her a compelling villain. Her singing? Let’s just say it’s a good thing mirrors don’t critique vocal pitch.

The dwarfs—oh, the dwarfs—are a CGI catastrophe. They look like they stumbled out of an uncanny valley focus group, with designs so jarring you’ll spend half their scenes wondering why Disney didn’t just hire real actors. The new songs from Pasek and Paul are forgettable at best, and at worst—like the cringe-inducing “Princess Problems”—they make you want to claw your ears off. The plot tries to “update” the story by ditching the prince for a bland Robin Hood wannabe, but it’s so padded with rebellion subplots and sanctimonious life lessons that it forgets to be fun or magical.

Visually, it’s a mess too—garish colors clash with gloomy shadows, and the enchanted forest looks like a rejected theme park set. At a bloated runtime, this *Snow White* feels like a slog, desperately grasping for relevance but missing the heart of the 1937 original. It’s not the woke disaster some feared, just a soulless, overstuffed cash grab that proves Disney’s live-action remake machine needs a serious timeout. Skip it unless you’re dying to see a deer eat soggy bread in 4K. 2/10.","You and 14 other people found this helpful.","14 people found this helpful."

The movie lacked some technical things but altogether was a very enjoyable, joyous and good movie. Everyone who didn't like Rachel's commentary on the film at D23 should really watch it. I think her comments were fair and Hollywood isn't fond of outspoken people who don't fit their pr trained mold. 10/10 would recommend for all ages. Stuff the reviews and enjoy the movie as if you've never seen or heard of Snow White before. It's a remake and its been decades since 1937.

However these quibbles were minor; everything else was truly wonderful. The story was beautiful and entertaining, and after witnessing Snow White’s growth and inner strength I was truly inspired. 

I appreciate the original for its innovative achievement in animation history, but for storytelling this version is likely the one I will be returning to whenever I want to experience this fairytale. I love the live action versions of my favorite stories and hope they continue to make them for many years to come. :)","You and 56 other people found this helpful.","56 people found this helpful."

From the opening scene, I knew I was in for something legendary. The sheer brilliance of the dialogue, the jaw-dropping CGI, and the unparalleled acting performances left me completely breathless. The colors? Vivid. The emotions? Raw. The dwarves? Utterly transformative.

And then—Gal Gadot. Oh. My. Villainous. Perfection. When she let out that iconic, gut-wrenching, soul-piercing scream of “NOOOOO!”, it was as if time itself had stopped. The entire theater erupted into thunderous applause, some openly weeping at the sheer power of that moment. I swear I heard someone whisper, “This is our generation’s Shakespeare.”

Rachel Zegler? A revelation. The way she gazed at the apple, the gravity of her every step, the sheer intensity of her dialogue delivery—it was like watching history unfold before my eyes. I saw at least three people faint from overwhelming artistic stimulation.

The story? Revolutionary. Disney has truly outdone itself in taking a beloved classic and elevating it to the heavens. The pacing was exquisite—not a single moment wasted, each second a precious jewel in the crown of cinema.

If you only watch one movie in your lifetime, make it this one. I am forever changed. Five stars are not enough—I demand a sixth star be created just for Snow White.

The ending happens quite quickly but it will definitely move you or give you butterflies. The movies message is about being kind to one another and use your power to help others and stand together against evil dictators! We all could take some advice from this movie since our society is definitely becoming more selfish/self-centered and too afraid to stand up to evil dictators!

I did my best to tune out all the negative publicity and interviews I'd read or seen and view the film with an open mind, but it was awful in nearly every aspect as far as being what I used to believe was the patented joy of watching a Disney movie.

I must have mentally tuned out the disgust I'd experienced in viewing Disney's flaming dump entry in the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise:
""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Dysentery""

Although Rachel Ziegler can adequately sing and  could be considered seriously more attractive than Phoebe Waller Bridge, her persona and performance, new(and supposedly improved...?)story elements, unsettling CGI, and overall tone of the film...with ideological messaging either slapping the audience in the face or being stuffed down their ears, eyes and throats...other performances, either underdeveloped or over-the-top and the film's interminable pacing brought back all that disturbed and dismayed me about Indiana Jones 5.

Being as I'm your typical ancient male I'm sure that my own disdain and displeasure for this incarnation of Snow White will likely seem less than noteworthy or valid.
Yet where I kept silent with my own counsel, the five very progressive and liberally minded women I accompanied were even more vitriolic and vigorous in their opinions!

Those are very big shoes to fill. 

I came into the theater not expecting much, because even if they were to remake Snow White exactly the same as the 1937 film, it still wouldn't do it justice. There's a reason why Walt Disney didn't want anyone messing with Snow White -- that movie was his baby. He even asked the original voice actress Adriana Caselotti to never audition for any other acting role to keep the image of Snow White in tact. There's also a reason why it's considered to be the movie staple of pioneering animation. 

Snow White (2025) is fine as a 2025 movie, and does nothing for the original film. The musical numbers are absolutely beautiful and truthfully Rachael Zegler did a phenomenal job with the singing, her acting was great too. She pulled off the kind, graceful, and sweet princess and I appreciated that. However, she didn't have the same mannerisms as the original Snow White in 1937 so I saw Rachael as another version of Snow White, not THE Snow White from the 1937 animation. 

With that being said, Rachael outshone Gal Gadot in every department. You may not like Rachael, but she carried that movie on her back. Gal Gadot had beautiful gowns... and that's it. Her acting was really bad and her villainous interpretation wasn't intimidating to me. She also can't sing which made her role even more laughable. The dwarves were a bit weird, it took some time to get used to - and truthfully, I wish they would've used real actors to bring more heart into the movie. There were literally three physical human dwarves in the film, yet they weren't cast as the dwarves?

I think this movie was mid, and it was entertaining, but it wasn't spectacular like the original Snow White in 1937. In some parts of the film, I felt they were teasing us with elements of the original film, but it felt short an unintentional. For example, the silly song was only 1 minute long, and there was no ""buddle Uddle Um Dum"", ""someday my prince will come"", and ""one song"" which made Snow White a classic.The modern songs got more serious screen-time, and that saddned me. They could've made the ""silly song"" and the ""buddle cuddle um dum"" cute and charming with amazing choreography with real dwarves. 

Overall the movie is okay. I don't think anyone should go run to see Snow White, unless they are a die hard Snow White fan and need to see the film and catch some new merchandise. You can wait until it comes out in Disney plus and it wouldn't make a difference. I really enjoyed Rachael's performance and glad I gave her a chance because her voice and acting carried the film. Everything else was forgettable slop, and by no means does it have the same essence, charm, and originality as the original 1937 film. Absolutely no comparison, and Walt Disney is definitely rolling on his grave with this one.","You and 351 other people found this helpful.","351 people found this helpful."

I have young family members that enjoyed it. The outfits leave much to be desired but it emphasizes that beauty is within because snow white does get more beautiful throughout. Rachel would have looked better with little one more inch of hair or curl. The dwarfs are my favorite but I would have enjoyed it more if they were real people. The “prince” had good character development and I could get over the fact that his a bandit and not a real prince but I wish he was😒 Rachel and Gal are talented there is no doubt but no one could really tell in the film. I never thought there could be anti-chemistry between actors but man Rachel and Gal should never share a screen ever again. Both of their individual scenes were fine and I knew both are good actors because I have seen them in other movies. When they were in scenes together, I struggled not to rip my eyes out. It was almost comedic because they acted like the other smelled or ran over their dog. Which you would think would be good for characters that are enemies but it wasn’t like they hated each other it was like they both made each other uncomfortable. This is fair due to the difference in political opinions and in general people don’t perform their best when they are uncomfortable. The bandits was a cute idea that I enjoyed and the love story was cute. Overall, the whole movie was an amazing idea that was poorly executed. Snow White is my favorite Disney princess and I wish they did it justice. But, if you look at it as a separate film and something that would be on Disney junior for kids. It’s a good movie. I would tell people to watch it draw their own opinions and not just listen to main stream media because I think most kids would genuinely enjoy the film.","You and 7 other people found this helpful.","7 people found this helpful."

Once a beloved tale of innocence, virtue, and redemption, Snow White has been gutted and repackaged as a soulless, agenda-driven spectacle dripping with communist propaganda and anti-Western sentiment.

Gone is the original message of grace, humility, and moral fortitude. In its place is a walking, talking political pamphlet that preaches the virtues of collectivism and class warfare under the guise of “empowerment.” Snow White, once the gentle and kindhearted heroine whose goodness triumphed over evil, has been reimagined as a bitter, insufferable revolutionary with a chip on her shoulder and a disdain for tradition, family, and men.

The dwarfs? Don’t call them that. The seven iconic characters, who symbolized hard work, individuality, and camaraderie, have been replaced with an arbitrary, diverse assortment of characters whose only shared trait is their hatred for hierarchy and merit. They don’t mine jewels anymore, that would be capitalist exploitation. No, now they form a commune, where no one works, everyone shares, and somehow magic provides. It’s a utopia straight out of Das Kapital.

The prince, once a symbol of love and sacrifice, is now a footnote, a clumsy, emasculated side character whose only role is to be lectured by Snow White about “toxic masculinity” and “patriarchal systems.” There’s no romance, no virtue, no joy, only resentment, entitlement, and lectures that sound more like they were pulled from a freshman gender studies syllabus than a fairy tale.

The Queen, traditionally a cautionary tale of vanity and sin, is now portrayed with far more nuance and sympathy than Snow White herself. In fact, one could be forgiven for thinking the film secretly sides with the Queen, at least she has clear motives and some charisma. Snow White just stomps around declaring herself a “leader” while insulting everyone who came before her.

Visually, the film is dark, gray, and sterile, fitting, perhaps, for its political overtones. The magic is gone. The wonder is dead. All that remains is a cold, collectivist sermon thinly veiled as family entertainment.

Disney has abandoned storytelling in favor of social engineering. Snow White (2025) is not a film; it’s a manifesto. It is a grotesque insult to its source material, its audience, and the values that once made Western storytelling beautiful.

If you’re looking for joy, truth, or even just decent entertainment, avoid this cinematic gulag at all costs. Snow White (2025) is the fairest in the land only if the land is North Korea.","You and 11 other people found this helpful.","11 people found this helpful."

And I don’t think their goal worked out very well this time.

If it were just a mediocre remake that follows the premise of the original film, it could have done well. But instead, they had to put their woke twist on the story. Her name is not Snow White because her skin is white, but because she was born on a snowy day. Then, instead of doing the kind act of cleaning the cottage for the seven dwarves like in the original film, the new twist is that she teaches the dwarves to clean their own house— not a good guest. Additionally, instead of being the fairest of them all because of her skin tone, she is described as the fairest of them all because it is her mission to bring a communist utopia to the kingdom. I don’t think that worked out for the other places that tried it—good thing they cut the movie before we could see the long-term effects of a crippled nation.

Last thing is that they refused to hire little people to act as the dwarves—as if it isn’t hard enough for them to find jobs, they had to prevent them from getting the one role they are perfect for.

Oh, and also, Jonathan Prince Charming’s got it all wrong. He should have been going for the evil stepmother ( Gal Gadot) as his love interest rather than Snow White.


While Gal Gadot is a beautiful actress, she doesn't quite pull off the villain role. A woman like her just doesn’t seem threatening, and that’s not meant as a compliment—she didn’t convincingly portray the menace required for the character, which demonstrates limits to her acting abilities.

As for Rachel Zegler, she outshone Gal Gadot in some ways, but her portrayal of Snow White was not good. At times, she showed more anger than elegance, which didn’t fit the character. Snow White should have been more graceful and composed.

Before I finish, I must mention how the two main actors in this film managed to piss off both Israeli and Palestinian supporters, by having Rachel Ziegler, an outspoken supporter of Palestine, and Gal Gadot, a proud Israeli woman. But I don’t blame the casting director for thinking they would cancel each other out and nobody would be upset. Maybe if they spared normal-minded, anti-woke individuals, which was the bigger problem, then a conflict in the Middle East would not have been the nail in the coffin and wouldn’t really affect the amount of tickets sold.

Welp, you get what you deserve. I give this woke propaganda film a 1-star rating. I would have given it zero, but we know how this works. Hopefully, creativity becomes a thing again at some point.","You and 36 other people found this helpful.","36 people found this helpful."

	2.	Snow White Isn’t White?
The lead actress, while talented, looks nothing like the fairytale character famously described as having “skin as white as snow.” It feels like the movie is trying to rewrite the character for political correctness rather than staying true to the source.
	3.	Too Much Woke, Not Enough Wonder
The film is soaked in modern political messaging—girlboss empowerment, anti-prince sentiment, and rejection of classic romantic tropes. It forgets it’s a fairytale.
	4.	Cringeworthy Dialogue
The script is filled with lines that sound more like TikTok quotes than a timeless story. Dialogue often feels forced, preachy, or laughably out of place.
	5.	Zero Chemistry
Romantic or otherwise, the characters lack believable connections. The charm, warmth, and heart of the original are gone.
	6.	Dull Visuals
For a Disney film, it’s shockingly lifeless. CGI is flat, colors are muted, and nothing looks magical. It’s more like a low-budget fantasy drama than a major fairytale remake.
	7.	Prince Erased
Instead of evolving the prince character, they nearly erased him. There’s no romance, no rescue, and no emotional payoff. What’s left is hollow.
	8.	Snow White’s Personality Overhaul
Instead of being kind, gentle, and hopeful, the new Snow White comes off as bitter, sarcastic, and too proud to believe in love. She’s less of a heroine and more of a lecture.
	9.	Bad Pacing, Boring Plot
The movie drags. Key scenes are rushed, others linger too long, and there’s no real tension or emotional stakes to keep viewers invested.
	10.	Disrespect to the Original
Instead of honoring the 1937 classic that launched Disney’s empire, this version mocks it. The original values are discarded in favor of modern commentary.

Final Verdict:
The new Snow White is less of a remake and more of a complete reinvention—and not in a good way. It feels like a hollow, politically driven rebranding of a classic, with none of the magic, love, or charm that made the original beloved for generations.

1/5 stars. Would rather rewatch the animated original ten times.","You and 48 other people found this helpful.","48 people found this helpful."

Certainly! Here's a glowing review for Disney's *Snow White*: --- Disney's *Snow White* breathes fresh life into the classic fairytale with a blend of breathtaking visuals, heartfelt performances, and an enchanting narrative. From the very first scene, the film captivates audiences with its stunning cinematography, vivid colors, and richly designed costumes that transport viewers into a magical world. The reimagined story strikes a perfect balance between honoring the spirit of the beloved 1937 animated classic and introducing modern themes that resonate with contemporary audiences. The characters are thoughtfully developed, with Snow White herself shining as a relatable and inspiring protagonist. The supporting cast brings humor, warmth, and depth to the tale, creating a beautifully layered ensemble. A highlight of the film is its musical score, which effortlessly weaves together new, emotionally stirring songs with nods to the iconic melodies that have long been cherished by fans. The result is a soundtrack that enhances the story's emotional impact and lingers in the audience's memory. Disney's *Snow White* is a triumph of storytelling and artistry, appealing to both nostalgic fans of the original and a new generation discovering the tale for the first time. It's a cinematic experience that reminds us of the enduring power of courage, kindness, and believing in our own strength. ---","You and 10 other people found this helpful.","10 people found this helpful."

Unfortunately, what I watched was not just disappointing, it was completely soulless. The magic, warmth, charm, and detail that made the original animated film beloved for generations has been replaced with a hollow, uninspired attempt at modernisation that completely misses the point.

Let’s start with the acting — wooden, over-exaggerated, and emotionally flat. There was no depth to the performances, and any attempt at sincerity was buried beneath awkward line delivery and overdone musical numbers. Why this had to be turned into some over-the-top, forced musical is beyond me. Instead of subtle charm and gentle humour, we were bombarded with forgettable songs that did little to move the story forward or enrich the characters. It felt like a cheap imitation of Broadway rather than a respectful tribute to a classic.

Most unforgivably, the live-action film guts the soul of the original story. All the rich detail — the scenes that made Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs feel like a fairy tale come to life — are simply gone.

Where are the forest animals that helped Snow White clean the cottage? Gone. Where is the heartwarming scene of her lovingly preparing dinner and tidying the dwarfs' chaotic home? Replaced with nothing of substance. 

In the original, we saw her sweeping, dusting, and even washing tiny clothes with the help of the birds and deer — it was whimsical and endearing. In this version, none of that remains. The sense of Snow White building a life and bond with the dwarfs through kindness and care is completely lost.

The charming sequence of the dwarfs returning home to a spotless house, their cautious curiosity turning to surprise, and then joy, is one of the most memorable scenes in the original. Gone. So is the classic moment where they find Snow White asleep across their beds, curled up like a child — a beautiful moment of innocence and vulnerability. Instead, we’re offered shallow interactions and no meaningful development of their relationship.

Even the most iconic lines are missing or reworded into bland nothingness. “Skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, hair as black as ebony” — a poetic and powerful moment from the Magic Mirror — is nowhere to be found. What we get instead is a watered-down version that lacks any of the original’s mystique or drama.

And the Queen? Once a menacing, glamorous villain with genuine gravitas, is now reduced to a caricature with little menace and zero elegance. The transformation scene — where she becomes the old witch — one of Disney’s most haunting and legendary moments, is entirely underwhelming here, if not completely ignored.
Disney has clearly tried to repackage Snow White into something more “modern,” but in doing so they’ve stripped it of everything that made it timeless. 

There's no heart, no enchantment, and absolutely no reverence for the story’s emotional core. It’s not an update — it’s an erasure.

This didn’t feel like Snow White. It felt like a parody that doesn’t understand why the original mattered in the first place. An utterly joyless experience that, frankly, I hope children skip in favour of the 1937 masterpiece — where the magic, warmth, and wonder still live on.

Snow White is a tale of evil vs. good, a common theme we see in many of today’s modern movies, the conflict is shown with a bad side and a good side. The live-action movie is nothing more than an adaptation of the original 1937 movie, or is it? When I saw this movie there were many things I took into account, such as how the movie showed the emotion of all the characters, the special effects, the storyline, and more. A small addition that was added to this movie that I thought positively of and wished the original explained more about is Snow White’s previous family. This film does a good job of explaining that and how Snow White came to how she came to be. Now while I do understand that this is a newer movie and that I get why Disney wanted to incorporate some changes into this movie to make it distinguishably differently from the 1937 animation, I want to mention that if you are looking for the same story from before, then I would not recommend you see this movie. Why? I say this because while there were some obvious similarities, like how the movie portrays Snow White’s emotion in the forest scene or the sudden back and forth contrast of mood when the dwarves are rushing to save Snow White while she is eerily eating the poisoned apple. While I do think these were some of the parts that conveyed a good resemblance to the original movie, I can definitely assure you the story is not the same. There are so many major plot point differences that change up the entire tale that everyone knows of Snow White. In the animation of the older movie, everything ends when the prince brings Snow White back to life with true love’s kiss, and the queen dies beforehand. This is not the case for the live action movie. Not only this but Dopey, the dwarf known for not being able to speak, spoke in this movie, which is a neat but not realistic modification. So if you asked me how much I should rate the movie Snow White based on it being an alteration of the original 1937 movie, I would tell you that this movie’s story certainly does not follow the same path as it’s previous one and you will not find the good of the movie in that. Though it may not be the same plot we all know and love, it has certain elements that make it unique in its own way and those certain elements add to the movie’s overall rating. Therefore, I am not going rate this movie a one star as you may have realized by now, I’m also not going to rate it five stars because I don’t think it didn’t reach that level of cinema. At the same time, I believe it showed a good and entertaining story. Maybe it wasn’t a story about Snow White, but it was a story that I’m willing to rate…three stars.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Once upon a time, in a studio far, far removed from its senses, Disney gave us a remake no one asked for, starring someone who apparently didn’t want to be in it. Welcome to Snow White (2025), the cinematic equivalent of eating a stale, gluten-free apple that somehow still gives you food poisoning.

Leading the charge is Rachel Zegler, a performer whose disdain for the original story is so palpable, you half expect her to break the fourth wall mid-film and start a TED Talk. From day one, Zegler made it very clear this Snow White isn’t about dreams, love, or magic—this Snow White is about power, girlbossing, and rewriting history one aggressively woke monologue at a time. If charisma were a poisoned apple, this film would be dead on arrival.

Gone is the innocent, wide-eyed charm that made generations fall in love with the original. In its place? A heroine who looks like she'd rather be hosting a climate summit than frolicking with woodland creatures. Zegler delivers her lines with the kind of passion you’d expect from someone reading a cease and desist letter. There’s a fine line between empowered and insufferable—and this performance sets up camp, builds condos, and holds a press conference on the wrong side of it.

But the problems don’t stop at the casting couch. The iconic seven dwarfs? Reimagined as an inclusive band of vaguely magical randos that look like they escaped from a Renaissance Faire HR seminar. Peter Dinklage complained about stereotypes, so Disney said, “Great idea! Let’s get rid of little people altogether!” Because apparently progress means nobody wins.

Gal Gadot, to her credit, serves up Evil Queen realness with enough cheekbone to slice through the mediocrity. Unfortunately, even her villainous couture can’t overshadow the fact that she’s working with dialogue that sounds like it was written by ChatGPT on a sugar crash.

Musically, the film tries to sprinkle in Broadway fairy dust, but the songs land with all the subtlety of a PowerPoint transition. You’ll remember none of them. At best, you’ll mildly tap your foot. At worst, you’ll wish the forest animals would stage a coup and bring back Alan Menken.

In short, Snow White is a film that tries to dismantle a classic—and forgets to replace it with anything magical. What’s left is a joyless, preachy parade of studio notes disguised as empowerment. The fairest of them all? Not even close. But it might just be the most awkward.

Rating Comment:

Disney's 2025 live-action remake of Snow White attempts to reimagine the classic tale for a modern audience. Directed by Marc Webb and starring Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, the film endeavors to blend nostalgia with contemporary themes.

Performance and Music:
Rachel Zegler delivers a commendable performance, bringing a fresh perspective to the titular character. Her vocal prowess shines, especially in the new musical numbers crafted by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. However, some critics felt that while Zegler's portrayal was captivating, the film's overall execution lacked cohesion.

Visuals and Direction:
The film boasts impressive production values, with detailed costumes and set designs that pay homage to the original. Yet, the overreliance on CGI, particularly in the depiction of the dwarfs, received criticism for lacking the charm of the 1937 classic.

Narrative and Themes:
This adaptation introduces a more proactive Snow White, aligning with contemporary values of empowerment. While this modern take is appreciated, some reviewers felt that the film struggled to balance its new themes with the essence of the original story, leading to a muddled narrative.

Conclusion:
While Disney's 2025 Snow White offers moments of brilliance, particularly through Zegler's performance and the updated musical score, it falls short in delivering a cohesive and compelling retelling of the beloved classic.

Rating: 6.5/10

Disney live action films used to use breathtaking settings but this film is clogged up with ai generated, cgi filled settings that have no depth at all. Rachel Zegler was not good at all, but comparing her to Gal Gadot makes her seem like a show stopper. Gadot had no expression or nuance, lacked any villain energy and essentially just looked good in the outfit. I was also annoyed by the completely unnecessary race swap of Snow White who in the original was described with “skin as white as snow”, which they completely changed in the new film but that was acceptable when compared to the other issues.The songs were forgettable, with “Waiting on a wish” being the only one worth listening to but still doesn’t reach the previous heights of Disney bangers and the villain song was made even worse by Gal Gadot’s dreadful “acting”.

This film tried to be magic, but what I got was less “happily ever after” and more “please let it be over already.”

Let’s start with the cinematography, which I guess is impressive if your idea of beauty is a color-corrected Instagram filter slapped over every scene. The enchanted forest looks like a theme park backdrop, and the castle halls have all the warmth of a luxury hotel lobby. Yes, it’s “pretty,” but in the way a screensaver is pretty — soulless, sterile, and designed to keep you from noticing how bored you are.

The music? Oh, the music. Each song feels like it was generated by an AI trained on Disney’s B-sides and motivational TikToks. Ballads so generic they could be swapped between this movie and an animated toothpaste commercial and no one would notice. I did get chills, though — but that was from the secondhand embarrassment.

As for performances, Snow White is… there. She’s got the grace of a motivational speaker and the emotional range of someone who just remembered their lines mid-scene. The supporting cast tries to bring charm and warmth, but it all feels forced — like a group project where everyone’s pretending to like each other until the cameras stop rolling.

The script claims to honor the classic story, but it mostly seems embarrassed by it. Instead of timeless fairy tale magic, we get awkward modern winks, recycled girlboss tropes, and enough clunky messaging to fill a TED Talk. It’s not a retelling — it’s a reboot that doesn’t trust its own source material.

In short: Snow White (2025) is a corporate fairytale wrapped in gloss, powered by focus groups, and hollow at its core. If you’re looking for a reminder of why we fell in love with fairytales in the first place, this ain’t it. But if you’re looking for a reminder of how to spend $200 million and still make something aggressively mid — well, congrats. Mission accomplished!","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

1. The CGI was atrocious and the Dwarves were an obvious afterthought
2. The plot and story development was horrible. The Dwarves and William accepted Snow White as their leader after a minute of talking. Really?
3. Every man was a mindless idiot. 
4. Gal Gadot would have been far more believable as Snow White than Racheal Ziegler
5. Gal Gadot has done far better. Her accent was so pronounced it was a distraction and her movements were too embellished making her appear as an exotic dancer in a club at times. 
6. Stop with the messaging and just write stories to escape political commentary. Listening to Doc speak about the evil queens political agendas and her use of tyranny to rule over the peasant class was so forced I wanted to get up and leave. 
7. Rachel Ziegler has an amazing voice, but her acting skills are not worthy of the big screen. Facial gestures were forced, her demeanor ranges from that of a pouty child to showing no emotion at all and forcing awkward facial gestures to try and fake emotions such as empathy, sympathy and happiness. I truly feel like she is a miserable person. 
8. I don’t know who wrote the final scene but it was worse than the Game of Thrones finale. And that’s being kind. It’s hard to believe that the entire climax is decided ima two minute long argument over what people remember about being kind to each other and friendships. Lazy writing at its worst. 
I am a current AMC stock holder, and if Hollywood, Disney, Marvel and such don’t start producing worth while films then they will continue to lose money fording an agenda no one wants and AMC will go bankrupt. Pardon me while I sell my AMC stock.","You and 677 other people found this helpful.","677 people found this helpful."

It’s disheartening to see so much negativity surrounding the new Snow White—especially from those who haven’t even taken the time to watch it. While everyone is entitled to their opinions, isn’t it only fair to see the story unfold before jumping to conclusions?

This reimagining isn’t about erasing tradition—it’s about evolving it. For years, women in fairy tales were boxed into roles that prioritized physical beauty and dependence on a rescuer. The new Snow White flips that narrative, celebrating inner beauty, strength, and independence. It’s a heroine that embodies kindness, resilience, and courage—qualities far more powerful than just being “the fairest of them all.”

Is the absence of Prince Charming or dwarfs really the issue—or is it the discomfort with a modern heroine who no longer relies on others to define her worth? This Snow White reminds us that every generation deserves stories that reflect their values and inspire them to see beauty not just in mirrors but in their actions and character.

Before jumping to conclusions, let’s celebrate the creativity, hard work, and passion that went into this reimagining. Art evolves, just like society does—and challenging norms opens the door for fresh perspectives and meaningful discussions. My family absolutely loved it, especially Dobby, who stole the show for us! Sure, I’m personally even more excited about Lilo & Stitch, but this tale has its own charm.

🎥 So why not watch it first, form your own opinion, and THEN join the conversation? Let’s judge it on what matters most—its heart and message. After all, isn’t that the fairest way to approach any story? 🍎✨","You and 18 other people found this helpful.","18 people found this helpful."

- rachel's singing is pretty good and held power which is what i think she was going for with trying to make snow white more empowered(?)..... anyways she sounded great
- rachel's facial expressions were very repetitive & its probably a habit of hers but its just one of the things that stood out to me. again this plays into another point why i think the acting sucks
- gal gadot looked the part of the evil queen, but thats it. it's probably just me but i don't think she suits playing someone who is supposed to carry evil aura. 

- pretty sure theres transcripts of disney saying not to touch snow white's story and lo and behold disney touched and tainted every part of it about a century later. that may be heresay but disney's son david hand did say this remake was insulting and i agree. it seems they wanted to make a ""woke"" movie and by all means if they wanted to create that type of story and princess, go ahead. but if they wanted to do that i wish they woulda just made a whole new story and princess instead of modernizing a CLASSIC from 1938. times are different then so make a new one for today ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
idk just my 2 cents
- idk what rachel was saying in that one interview with cutting jonathan's scenes out. if they cut him out she would have been sleeping forever LMAOOO unless some other true love's kiss was gonna come get her or she just has insane plot armor and miraculously wakes up despite the conditions of the poison apple's spell

- cinematography and visual effects were STUNNING and princess problems was a catchy song 

overall, did not like this movie LOL. coming from someone who grew up with the original, i tried going into this completely unbiased. but, in the end was impossible. the movie did SO much and nothing at the same time. everything felt so shallow and empty and basic. it had zero depth and evoked zero emotion out of me which is saying something because i am a very emotional person and cry at nearly everything. i cried when harry potter caught his first snitch which was so weird. i cried when in ultraman rising he was teaching the baby kaiju to fight and when his assistant mina got decommissioned AND when the momma kaiju nearly died. like YO and i didn't feel a single emotion in this remake  ¯\_(ᵕ᷄≀ ̠˘᷅ )_/¯","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

(Specifically, the outfits and jewelry on the evil queen and the rendering of the dwarves and their home, and especially when they were in their mind and lighted it up, and it kind of resembled the dwarf city in Lord of the rings)
- It has a happy ending, thankfully, but not entirely satisfying for a number of reasons I will address below.
- I appreciate there was no rude humor or gore in the presentation which so many “modern “cartoons or live animation remake insert such as the new Lilo and stitch movie that’s coming out… And I don’t plan to see it because of crude humor, and occasional mean spiritedness that was not in the original cartoon.

There is more unpleasantness in this version of Snow White than in the original Disney cartoon. Viewers should be aware of that, and that there is a description in the credit saying that the grim fairy tale’s version was also used as a resource.

Did not like:
- The “inclusive “ - Motivated changes to the characters and the storyline. I was very uncomfortable with the dwarf Dopey being presented as someone with an autistic spectrum disorder, making him mute and self-conscious. 

I don’t think that that’s really teaching kids positive values about including others. Although it does get resolved Nicely we should remember Inclusiveness is complex and very situational. In my opinion as a counselor, that’s just not something you drop on kids that are third grade and younger.

(Just looking at developmental stages of typical children. You should be learning by example from your parents and other role models)

- I did not like the addition of Robin Hood style bandits helping the princess.

- Did not like most of the songs except the traditional ones like “hi ho hi ho” and the ever-popular “whistle while you work “. 

-  I’m glad they didn’t make it “gray “ Storytelling (Blurring the lines of good and evil ) And try to sow sympathy for the evil stepmother! 

- It lacked a powerful climax. It was just a dull ending with a relatively wimpy queen and unsatisfying confrontation between her and Snow White.

- we really don’t know what happens to the evil queen after she runs back into the castle when her guards side with Snow White.

- Did not care for the role of the animals in the story which were more animatronic than realistic . I think a remake in a cartoon version would’ve handled this better.

I don’t understand why people have reviewed it so badly but it’s definitely not what I expected as a musical!

The music is nowhere of the caliber of the songs in the lion King, for example. They’re not the kind you want to sing along with and play in the car. And there’s really nothing memorable about any of The characters.

Mediocre but not terrible.

 It doesn’t insult your IQ or glorify bad morality, or humor at the expense of others. So I think that puts it ahead of most of the offerings in the theaters right now.","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

Perhaps if Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had audited this production, they could have trimmed the excesses and saved Disney from this financial fiasco. ￼

In their quest to modernize the classic tale, Disney cast Rachel Zegler as Snow White, a decision that sparked debates reminiscent of casting a cat to play a dog in a biopic. Zegler’s own critiques of the original 1937 film, labeling the Prince as a “stalker,” add layers of irony thicker than the forest foliage.

The reimagined seven dwarfs, now a diverse ensemble of CGI magical creatures, have left audiences pining for the days when dwarfs were, well, dwarfs. Peter Dinklage’s criticism of the “backward story” led Disney to consult with the dwarfism community, resulting in a portrayal that satisfies no one and perplexes everyone.

Financially, “Snow White” has stumbled out of the gate, opening to a tepid $43 million domestically against its hefty $250 million budget. It seems that in their pursuit of a socially conscious narrative, Disney overlooked the fundamental aspect of filmmaking: creating a movie that people actually want to watch.

In their endeavor to be “woke,” Disney has inadvertently lulled audiences into a slumber deeper than Snow White’s enchanted sleep. Perhaps it’s time for the studio to remember that while inclusivity is important, it shouldn’t come at the expense of storytelling, character integrity, and, evidently, box office revenue.","You and 27 other people found this helpful.","27 people found this helpful."

The musical numbers.... Well, the old classics remain and they are the highlight. 

The new songs, however, fall into a lot of the tropes of trying to have a ""big musical number"" with various parts being long, drawn out, and overly dramatic, rather than interesting and catchy. 

The message is that hard times often push people to be selfish and cruel as a matter to survive and that it creates a self perpetuating cycle which reinforces ""tough times"" and that charity and community and reminding each other of the better qualities of our neighbors whom we are fighting is the only real solution ...

It's entirely to appropriate and it's blatant metaphor for current politics is perhaps forgivable if only for how much it needs to be said these days.

Disney’s latest retelling of Snow White isn’t just a fairytale—it’s a mirror held up to the fractured face of modern America. With stunning visuals, an earnest heart, and more than a little political spice, this Snow White becomes more than just a family film. It’s an allegory. A timely, fearless, and sharply observed one.

At the center of the story is a new kind of heroine: kind but not naive, brave but not reckless. Think AOC with a tiara—articulate, compassionate, and unwilling to back down in the face of authoritarian vanity. She stands not just for what’s right, but for the possibility of rebuilding something better from the rubble.

And then there’s the Evil Queen. Oh, the Evil Queen. She’s a pitch-perfect symbol of everything wrong in our times—vain, cruel, and desperate to hold onto power no matter the cost. Her obsession with control, wealth, and image—sound familiar?—makes her less of a fantasy villain and more of a composite sketch from cable news.

The magic mirror here might as well be Twitter. The poisoned apple? A toxic brew of disinformation and fear. And the dwarves—renamed and reimagined as a diverse group of everyday heroes—represent the resistance: workers, thinkers, healers, dreamers. The kind of coalition it takes to stand up to tyranny.

What’s so powerful is how subtly Disney weaves in this message. It’s not heavy-handed or preachy. It’s smart. Kids will enjoy the color and adventure, while adults will recognize the subtext: this is about a fight for the soul of a nation.

Of course, it will probably send the MAGA faithful into another round of foam-mouthed outrage. But that’s not a flaw—it’s a feature. This Snow White is an a fable for the decent, the hopeful, the awake.

In short: a classic tale, retold with urgency and elegance, for a world that badly needs it. Bring your kids. Bring your friends. And bring your conscience.

Five stars.","You and 20 other people found this helpful.","20 people found this helpful."

If you haven’t seen the movie and you’re posting bad reviews/comments stop it! You’re just a follower and you need to start thinking for y’all’s self. Rachel is stunning and drop dead gorgeous🥰🥰 

And by the way the whole point of a remake is to not make it not like the original,(cause even if they did make it the exact same yall would still throw shade about that) there’s still a prince she still gets saved by him it’s just revisioned for the generation we are in, 88 years later mind you!

If this were the in-flight movie, I’d seriously consider a high-altitude exit sans parachute.

Rachel Zegler’s Snow White is less a character and more a walking TED Talk on empowerment, delivering lines with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen, meanwhile, exudes the menace of a mildly irritated librarian, making one yearn for the days when villains were actually, well, villainous.

The seven dwarfs, now rendered in CGI that can only be described as “nightmare fuel,” resemble the unholy offspring of garden gnomes and whatever lurks under your bed. Their presence is so unsettling that one wonders if the animators were actively seeking revenge on audiences.

Musically, the film oscillates between forgettable new numbers and butchered classics, each song a fresh assault on the eardrums. The choreography appears to have been inspired by a malfunctioning Roomba, with dance sequences that defy both gravity and good taste.

In conclusion, this “Snow White” remake is a cautionary tale about the perils of fixing what isn’t broken. It’s a film that manages to be both hilariously inept and soul-crushingly dull—a true achievement in cinematic misadventure. Save yourself the ticket price and the ensuing existential dread; some stories are better left in the past.","You and 24 other people found this helpful.","24 people found this helpful."

Snow White should be a princess born in a castle even if it’s deprived of her privileges she should a Disney princess enchanting quality which is lacking in this movie.

The problem with me watching it is the most memorable description of Snow White in the original is 
""skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony” but this movie explains ‘ the princess is named Snow White because she was born during a snowstorm‘ ( -__-!#)
I was wishing to hear the ‘I’m wishing’ with the prince ‘one song’ it’s all just my wish because the new song errrr….( -__-!#). Well it sounds ok but yea just yea ok…

The new Snow White film had the potential to bring a beloved fairy tale to life, but unfortunately, several creative choices left me deeply disappointed. From questionable casting decisions to missed opportunities for better representation, it feels like the studio made one misstep after another.

First, let’s talk about the casting of the Evil Queen. While Gal Gadot is undeniably a talented actress, her involvement in this film has been controversial due to her outspoken political views. Given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Palestine, many people feel that her presence in a major film is tone-deaf and divisive. It’s a decision that Disney surely knew would cause backlash, yet they went ahead with it anyway.

Then there’s the casting of Snow White herself. As the title suggests, Snow White is traditionally portrayed as a fair-skinned German princess. Instead, the studio opted for a Latina actress, Rachel Zegler, which feels like a departure from the source material. While diversity in Hollywood is important, historical and cultural accuracy also matter, and this choice felt forced rather than organic. Additionally, some of her public interviews came across as dismissive of the original film, which didn’t help win over fans of the classic.

Another major controversy was the handling of the Seven Dwarfs. Instead of hiring actors with dwarfism, Disney chose to use CGI to shrink average-sized actors, including Peter Dinklage, who has previously criticized the original story. This decision not only took roles away from little people in the industry but also came across as an unnecessary attempt to “modernize” something that didn’t need fixing.

Overall, this movie feels like a product of misguided corporate decisions rather than a true love letter to the classic fairy tale. Between the casting controversies, historical inaccuracies, and the studio’s reluctance to embrace the original vision, it’s hard to find anything to truly enjoy. I’m giving this film one star—a disappointing take on a timeless story.","You and 10 other people found this helpful.","10 people found this helpful."

Although Snow White isn't as white as printer paper, at least Disney explained because she was borned in bitter storm of snow. Plus imo, Snow White this name isn't just about being white but being kind and pure, it's a symbol of kindness. Anyone can play Snow White if the story is just about kindness. And I dont think it's woke of her to wish to be a leader. It's totally normal, she wants to be like her father and wished to spread more kindness, so I don't think it's that bad as we thought.

Besides, Rachel said Snow White isn't saved by a prince is true...SPOILER: She was saved by  a rebel instead. They had quite a chemistry, not just random prince kissing a dead corpse, Lmao. Plus I loved that they showed the evil queen was using a sleeping spell which onoy can be broken by a true kiss, so I think it's kinda logical why she is revived by a kiss. 

And yes the CGI dwarfs...they looked kinda weird but it's hilarious. The voice actors were great espiacally George Salazar who voiced Happy, they all did a great job at presenting their personality. But people say dwarfsim actors deserves the roles. Tbh, I absolutely believe that actors with dwarfism deserve opportunities and more diverse, meaningful roles. But not every fictional character who’s short is automatically a role meant for dwarfism representation. Some characters are just… weird magical creatures with goofy looking faces. And that’s ok. Representation is important, but it also has to make sense in context — not every movie is built to carry that kind of message. Let’s aim for deeper, cooler, more realistic characters — not just default ‘dwarf = representation’ roles.”

And yeah lastly, the songs were banger!!! Benj and Justin did a great job on the songs! Waiting on a wish is my fav and Hi Ho was kinda improved and interesting. And the romance song of Snow White and the rebel (Jothanan) was kinda sweet and made their relationship better and more chemistry ;)","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Casting and Representation

Lead actress Rachel Zegler faced backlash for her comments about the original 1937 animated film, describing the prince as a “stalker” and suggesting that the love story was outdated. This perspective drew criticism from fans who felt it undermined the classic tale.

The casting of Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen also attracted attention due to her past military service in Israel, leading to protests during the film’s promotional events amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.

The Dwarfs Controversy

The portrayal of the seven dwarfs has been a focal point of criticism. Actor Peter Dinklage expressed dismay over Disney’s decision to revisit a story featuring stereotypical depictions of dwarfs, prompting the studio to announce a “different approach” by consulting with members of the dwarfism community. However, the final film utilized CGI characters, which some advocates felt was an insufficient response to the concerns raised.

Thematic Shifts and Critical Reception

The film introduces significant changes to the original narrative, including the removal of the traditional prince character and a focus on Snow White’s leadership journey. While some critics appreciated these updates, others felt the execution was lacking. The Guardian’s review described the performances of Zegler and Gadot as “the dullest of their lives,” and noted that the film’s costume design and storytelling choices failed to resonate.

Box office performance has been underwhelming, with the film earning $87 million globally in its opening weekend, below expectations. Analysts attribute this to mixed reviews and audience reception, suggesting that the film’s departure from traditional Disney storytelling may not have connected with viewers as intended.

Cultural and Societal Implications

Beyond the immediate controversies, the film has been critiqued for its portrayal of ageism and the commodification of youth. The Guardian highlighted how the narrative reinforces societal pressures on women to maintain youthful appearances, reflecting broader cultural anxieties about aging and beauty standards.

In summary, Disney’s Snow White remake has ignited discussions on cultural sensitivity, representation, and the evolution of classic narratives, reflecting the complexities of adapting traditional stories for contemporary audiences.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The plot is scattered, hard to follow, and overall poorly written; it’s reminiscent of a cruise line misadventure. The characters bounce back and forth between attempting to fit into a poorly defined historical period and matching campy, modern songs. The beauty, magic, and sheer terror that made Snow White (1930s version) a true childhood classic is watered down and lost. Though Zegler claimed that the love story was ‘completely removable,’ it was one of the only plot points that was trackable. There was no true underlying plot driver other than the father —who got no resolution whatsoever— though they briefly set up multiple options. (Economic instability and its connection to the mines, how is the Evil Queen magical? Why did the townspeople randomly remember that they had a life previous to the last ten years??) Don’t even get me started on the Dwarves debacle, because it is truly disappointing that Disney couldn’t highlight actors with dwarfism in the iconic roles from the movie while hiring a token actor with dwarfism to say a total of 3 lines and shoot a crossbow to fill a plothole. This is a gross oversight of a huge opportunity to highlight actors with dwarfism. Another critique, there was no actor in the film I could honestly call good, as every interaction was forced or superficial. The costumes were a mixture of spirit Halloween and millennial-modern black box play, and the lighting made everything look overly saturated and fake. Snow White is supposed to be a Grimm fairytale, not a sun-soaked fever dream. To wrap up the debacle, the ending of this movie was a very nonsensical attempt to make Snow White’s ‘name remembering talent’ enough to unseat what is supposed to be an ultra-powerful authoritarian ruler. Plausible.On the heels of great remakes like Cinderella, Maleficent, the Beauty and the Beast, and most recently, The Little Mermaid, this film lost Snow White’s core, which is love and care. Disney also sidelined the major event of the fairytale, which is the sleeping curse. I think Snow White must have been asleep all of four minutes. Thank goodness I waited to view this until I had free access on Disney+. Fumble by Disney.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Gervais and Gadot deliver the same message: actors, please stick to acting to preserve your brand for the fans who fuel your income, name, and stature. 

Gervais is like a Cessna touching down, raw and unfiltered, on a jungle strip. Gadot, by contrast, is like an Airbus, exuding poise, feminine energy, and grace. Both are saying that actors owe their success to their audience and should focus on their craft to keep that loyalty intact.

There is a reason why Gadot is loved while Rachel Zegler catches flak. Zegler's vocal anti-Trump stance, pro-Palestinian views, and Israeli critique have split her fanbase. By contrast, at the ADL, Gadot declared with an infectious energy that unites rather than divides, ""I'm Jewish and proud to be one."" It was a masterclass in staying above the fray while building a fan base that adores her authenticity.  

Gadot as the Evil Queen is the ultimate villain, and villains don't usually save movies. But her star power transcends the role. She'd be the magnet that packs theatres, drawing the audience she deserves. 

Fans will show up for her, stay for the magic, and leave raving about her captivating, nuanced performance. She'll elevate the film from good to unforgettable, keeping the buzz about the story, not politics.  

Gadot is why Snow White will shine! 

Peace!

The Snow White character has been updated for modern sensibilities, and Zegler is an OK actress with a great singing voice.  Gadot is a fine actress who struggles with her songs as the villain.  Merge them together and you'd have had one half of a great casting.
Most of the classic songs are back (Someday My Prince Will Come being an obvious omission) and a new song was added that is, as a common theme to this film, adequate.  I doubt the soundtrack will be a hit.
If you have kids that want to see this one, take them.  You won't be greatly entertained, but you won't exit the theater feeling like you've been robbed of two hours of your life.

Firstly, the narrative suffers from significant pacing issues. The story's development appears both rushed and sluggish, leaving viewers disconnected from the characters' journeys. Critical plot points, which should evoke strong emotions, disappointingly feel lackluster due to insufficient build-up and exploration of character backstories.

The character portrayals, notably of Snow White herself, lacked depth and authenticity. Her transformation from an innocent maiden to a courageous heroine seemed forced and unconvincing. Furthermore, the antagonistic dynamics with the Evil Queen appeared clichéd and devoid of the threatening aura necessary to elevate tension.

Visually, although the film leveraged advanced CGI, the over-reliance on digital effects detracted from the film's organic charm. While the magical elements should have enhanced the visual storytelling, they instead contributed to an over-saturated viewing experience, leaving background details muddled and unfocused.

Compounding these issues was the inadequately composed soundtrack. Given the film's intent to reinvent, one would expect a compelling auditory experience; instead, the music seemed to amplify the film’s flaws, lacking the thematic harmony required to bind the scenes together.

On a positive note, the film's attempt to introduce contemporary social themes was commendable but ultimately underdeveloped, which left them feeling superficial rather than integral to the plot.

In conclusion, the 2025 Snow White film, while ambitious in scope, misses the mark due to its poorly executed narrative, shallow character development, and overwhelming reliance on digital effects. It stands as a testament to how not all classics benefit from modernization without careful consideration of storyline coherence and depth.

This movie somehow managed to murder the original story, bury it in a shallow grave, and then throw glitter on it hoping we wouldn't notice. Spoiler alert: we noticed.

Let’s start with the script. It’s like they put ChatGPT in a blender with a Tumblr post and a corporate diversity seminar and called it a screenplay. Dialogue was either painfully modern or cringe-inducingly wooden. Every line sounded like it was ripped from a bad motivational poster or a TikTok rant.

Then there’s Snow White herself — a character so devoid of charm, warmth, or personality that I was actually rooting for the Evil Queen. At least she had a vibe. Snow White, meanwhile, came off more like a mildly irritated intern than a heroine.

The dwarfs (sorry, the “mystical forest companions” or whatever sanitized name they’re using now) were so bland and unmemorable I forgot them mid-movie. And the CGI? I’ve seen better effects in 2002 cereal commercials. At one point I think the apple was green-screened in. I’m not joking.

And don’t get me started on the music. It sounded like AI-generated karaoke sung through a tin can. Every time a character broke into song, I prayed it would be the last — only to be punished again moments later. The only thing magical about the soundtrack was how fast it made me mute my TV.

In conclusion, this film is not a reimagining. It’s a re-traumatizing. It’s not empowering. It’s embarrassing. The only thing “fair” about this version of Snow White is that I now fairly warn everyone: run.

The reimagined story strikes a perfect balance between honoring the spirit of the beloved 1937 animated classic and introducing modern themes that resonate with contemporary audiences. The characters are developed, with Snow White herself  as a protagonist. The supporting cast brings something to the tale, creating a  layered layers of layers.

A highlight of the film is its musical score, which effortlessly weaves together new, emotionally stirring songs with nods to the iconic melodies that have long been cherished by fans. The result is a soundtrack that enhances the story's emotional impact and lingers in the audience's memory.

Disney's *Snow White* is a triumph of storytelling and artistry, appealing to both nostalgic fans of the original and a new generation discovering the tale for the first time. It's a cinematic experience that reminds us of the enduring power of courage, kindness, and believing in our own strength.","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

If you thought Disney’s 2025 Snow White reboot would breathe new life into the classic fairytale, think again. This film is a masterclass in how to ruin a beloved story with lifeless performances, tone-deaf writing, and a complete lack of magic.

First, let’s talk about the casting — or rather, the complete miscasting. The lead actress, while talented in other roles, is woefully out of place here. Her portrayal of Snow White lacks the charm, innocence, or any trace of charisma. Instead of a character you root for, she feels like a moody theatre student in a high school production — all melodrama and no substance.

The seven dwarfs? Wait, scratch that — they’re no longer dwarfs. In a bid to be “progressive,” Disney awkwardly removed the very thing that made them iconic, replacing them with a random group of generic sidekicks who each have the personality of wet cardboard. It’s inclusion without intention, and the result is a confusing mess that alienates both longtime fans and new audiences.

The CGI is astonishing — astonishingly bad. The forest animals look like they belong in a 2008 mobile game, and the magical elements are so bland that even children might check their watches. Not to mention the pacing, which drags on endlessly. A 90-minute story somehow feels like an eternity of virtue-signaling dialogue and plotless wandering.

The villain, who should’ve been a show-stealing queen dripping with vanity and menace, is reduced to a one-dimensional lecture on internalized misogyny. If you’re looking for campy, evil brilliance, keep looking — she’s less Maleficent and more mildly annoyed substitute teacher.

In short, Snow White (2025) is less a fairytale and more a cautionary tale — of what happens when a studio becomes so focused on messaging that it forgets storytelling altogether. It’s a soulless, joyless, preachy mess that’s neither entertaining nor enchanting. Disney tried to rewrite history, and instead, they rewrote a disaster.

1 out of 5 stars. Just watch the 1937 version again — it’s still the fairest of them all.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Despite the controversies, I felt like 99.99% of the stuff in the movie worked. The CGI dwarves worked and aren’t as jump scary as they seemed in the trailers. They also blended well into the setting, as in despite being CGI they didn’t look noticeably unreal compared to the rest of the cast. 

If you are worried about Snow White not looking “white”, Rachel Zegler looks pretty white and very similar in my head to what the original Snow White looked like in the vast majority of shots. In fact, in direct sunlight she looks whiter than a lot of other white people I know. Could they have perhaps done a little bit more playing with lighting in scenes with orangish light which brings out the darker parts of her skin tone? Perhaps. 

Despite the lack of a “prince”, there was still an absolute love story and it worked. In fact, I’m not quite sure why the movie was represented as it was way back when because of that. Even not being one to one with all concepts/characters of the original, it still felt true to the heart of the original. Despite the claims of “girl boss”, there was nothing that Snow White did that I felt would be considered solely modern feminist. She was strong, but her strength came from characteristics and values that aligned fairly well with the original. In fact, it was giving me vibes of other renditions of fairy tale movies from the 1990s/2000s like “Ever After”, “Ella Enchanted”, etc. in terms of characteristics and values. And it wasn’t anti-prince either, it’s just the plot took precedence over the wishing aspect and the romance unfolded organically. 

Acting was great all around. Songs were great. In fact, the only (slight) weak link to me was the third outfit Gal wore as the evil queen. Don’t get me wrong, Gal looked beautiful in it, that wasn’t the issue. The issue is that the stained glass window inspired headpiece and cape in that scene felt iconic, but then they were overshadowed by the shiny sequins (yes, obviously they were sequins)(weird, weird) on the dress. Should’ve gone with a black and purple ensemble and maybe sew some of the gems into it or something. But, what do I know?


 I do want to say to Disney though if you are reading this, though I personally liked your take, there are clearly enough people that are upset for one reason or another that it might be best to cool it on too many personal liberties with the original storyline going forward.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

I really loved the way the Queen talked too😆 her voice was perfect for the role.
The only thing I wish they had added was a backstory on the evil queen and scenes of her father's death would've made the poisoning scene more tragic. They did add so much from the original cartoon except her red headband and them adding sleeves to her dress.

The critics didn’t like it, I get that. But the audience is giving it positive reviews from what I see.

One minute you’re in a Tim Burton–esque dreamscape, the next you’re watching covert ops in hoodies and combat boots. And don’t get me started on the CGI dwarfs: they look like they belong more in a video-game promo than alongside live actors.

I’ll give it credit for trying something new and for a few catchy song moments, but it never quite finds its footing.

Just finished watching Marc Webb's reimagined Snow White, and I must say I genuinely enjoyed it. First, I want to say that no, this review is NOT sponsored by anyone, and yes, I am very much a fan of musicals and Disney live-actions.

I also want to acknowledge that yes, I'm aware of the ""controversies"" (and the bashing and trolling) this film has amassed for as long as its conception. I will NOT participate in those, as I will be keeping my review only about my experience watching the movie itself.

Anyways, on to my review...

There's definitely much to love about this adaptation. There's no denying that Rachel Zegler is the star of the show. Her powerful, dulcet voice really carries Snow White's emotions through the screen. Her musical performance is impeccable and enjoyable, and her acting is very much compelling. She is Snow White, and no amount of bashing, hating, or trolling can change that. If anything, Zegler has become even more of a Snow White in real life, with all the bashing she's been getting because of who she is and her beliefs, and the way she's been handling them. She is graceful, and she has integrity.

Gal Gadot definitely looks the Evil Queen. However, her musical performance is a bit stiff. It feels almost like she's only casted because she looks the Evil Queen. There's no denying that Gadot is a great actor, but her singing and dancing are a bit questionable. Her performance does not shine as much as Zegler, and I'm as much disappointed myself for saying that. I wanted her so much to be the evilest queen of all, but, alas, she falls short in the musical performance.

Andrew Burnap, the ""prince charming"", or should I say the ""not a prince 
but still charming"" lover of Snow White, is definitely a surprise for me. I've never seen him in any films before, so didn't know much about his acting capabilities, but I was pleasantly surprised by his performance—and by his conventional ""prince charming"" look. He definitely sold it for me.
The CGI dwarves make a lot of sense. No, they're not grotesque or scary. No, this movie is not anti-little people (you'll see). In fact the dwarves are adorable, especially Dopey! The film really did a great job mixing humans and CGI characters/creatures together. It did not feel like I was being taken out of the story by the CGI at all. In fact, the details and the oddities make them believable, even more interesting.

The songs/musical numbers are absolutely catchy and relatable! They'll definitely make you want to dance on your seat, or hum the songs with them, or get teary eyed (like me). The only ones I didn't enjoyed as much were the Evil Queen's. Again, I thought Gadot was a bit awkward.

The story/plot itself is quintessential Disney: light, enchanting, uncomplicated. It is very much a good-versus-evil movie. Perhaps a little too uncomplicated. I wanted to see more of the Evil Queen's backstory, and whatever happened to Snow White's father, the King. But I'm sure that would've been too much for the Disney purists.

I would give this movie 4/5 stars for musical, Disney live-action standard. The film is enchanting, Zegler is compelling, the songs/musical performance are captivating. (Wicked has set the bar quite high for musicals.) But really, I urge you to see this film, if only for curiosity or even for love of the old school Disney magic.","You and 42 other people found this helpful.","42 people found this helpful."

From its incoherent script to its unsettling CGI, the film is a textbook example of how not to handle a beloved property.

Rachel Zegler’s performance as Snow White is one of the film’s biggest missteps. Rather than embodying the warmth, kindness, and charm that defined the original character, Zegler delivers a performance that is painfully flat and uninspired. Her line delivery lacks emotion, and her presence on screen is devoid of the necessary charisma to carry a film of this scale. Instead of coming across as a relatable heroine, her Snow White feels disengaged and unlikable, making it impossible for audiences to connect with her journey.

As for Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen, her performance is equally underwhelming. Rather than exuding menace and regality, she stumbles through the role with an awkward, almost cartoonish portrayal that robs the character of any real threat. Her scenes, which should have been dripping with intimidation and grandeur, instead feel like forced attempts at camp that fall completely flat.

The film’s decision to replace the seven dwarfs with CGI “magical creatures” is another baffling creative choice that only makes the movie worse. These characters look unsettling rather than whimsical, and their lack of personality strips away one of the most iconic elements of the original film. The CGI itself is shockingly poor for a Disney production, making every scene with these creatures a chore to sit through.

Narratively, the film is a complete mess. In a misguided attempt to update the story for modern audiences, Disney has removed key elements of Snow White’s original arc and replaced them with half-baked themes of empowerment that feel forced and hollow. The result is a protagonist with no clear motivations or growth, stumbling through a poorly paced plot that fails to engage at any point.

The musical numbers are equally lifeless. The new songs lack any memorable melodies, and even the classic numbers feel shoehorned in rather than organically woven into the story. Zegler, despite having a musical background, fails to bring any real magic to the songs, making even the musical elements a disappointment.

In the end, Snow White (2025) is an unmitigated failure, a film that no one asked for and even fewer will enjoy. It strips away everything that made the original special, replacing it with soulless CGI, lackluster performances, and a confused, uninspired script. Disney’s latest attempt at a live-action remake is not just bad—it’s an embarrassment.","You and 211 other people found this helpful.","211 people found this helpful."

When it comes to the overall view of the new adaptation of Snow White, the main take away is clear as day: it’s meant to tell a story from a fresh perspective while maintaining the ideology of keeping the original story from the fairytale of the Spanish (Spain) princess. *research* 

Now keeping this in mind, Marc Webb did a fantastic job by keeping in line with the vision of the greatest dreamer of our parent’s timeline: Walt Disney. Knowing that Disney’s greatest critics were not of the political world or the general public, but of his peers telling him creating a full length animated movie was impossible, he ignored all odds and did it anyway.  When Marc Webb was told critics with no experience in the entertainment industry were complaining and whining and acting out on their own political views of racism and feminism, he did exactly what Disney did. Ignored the naysayers and produced a beautiful film. 

That being said here’s my professional view of this film. Diving into the back story of Snow Whit’s parents told a grander story of who Snow White was supposed to be. However the choreography of the first few scenes seemed slow paced and relaxed. This shows how the king was relaxed in his rule to ignore the signs of someone wicked and evil. This itself shows the story telling from a different perspective because by the end of the film, the choreography was fast paced, exciting, and strong in their movements. 

There were some simple words in the choruses that seemed to keep me from being interested in remembering the lyrics. I would have used a little more profound vocabulary in order to give it a little more of an umph effect. 

As far as the seven dwarves, they were cute, whimsical, and stuck to their true characters to their names! Although some may seem to think that being “Happy” or “Doc” could be easy since it’s within their name, but the acting and facial expressions perceived from the CGI added a little more magic behind their characters. Especially during some of the sad moments. 

Indeed it would be more acceptable to have a better casting to enhance the idea of having a live animated film, but I can see why they decided against it. 

This was a well rounded theater production when it came to blocking, staging, lighting, and more proving that having a clear view of the story telling throughout the film. The poses of Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen with her hands were absolutely perfect. The front face of gas lighting that the Evil Queen provided thoroughly composed the true evil of what evil really is: selfishness is the pedestal.

From the moment it started, I felt a deep, existential regret settle in. The kind of regret you feel when you realize you left your stove on, except instead of a stove, it was my faith in cinema, and instead of a fire, it was this absolute dumpster inferno of a film.

Let's talk about the plot-except, wait! There wasn't one. It was like watching someone take the original Snow White, stick it in a blender, pour it into a mold shaped like a TikTok influencer's idea of ""empowerment,"" and then leave it in the sun for a few months. What was left? A mushy, confused, joyless mess that somehow managed to be both condescending and lifeless at the same time.

The characters? Oh, you mean the personality vacuums with names? Snow White had the charisma of a damp sponge, and the dwarves-oh wait, sorry, ""magical forest people"" or whatever nonsense they tried to sell us-were so forgettable that I could've sworn they were AI-generated stock characters. The Evil Queen was the only one with any personality, and I found myself rooting for her, just so this cinematic abomination could end quicker.

The CGI? I've seen PlayStation 2 cutscenes with more effort put into them. The magical creatures looked like they were rendered on an Etch A Sketch by someone who just found out what computers are. At one point, I think I saw a bird T-pose mid-flight.

The script? I'd call it lifeless, but that would imply it was ever alive to begin with. Every line sounded like it had been rewritten fifteen times by a committee of people who hate fun. There was no wit, no charm, no whimsy-just a series of self-important, dull monologues that made me long for the sweet release of the end credits.

By the time the final act rolled around, I had given up. My soul had left my body. I was merely a husk of the person I was before watching this. If you told me I had hallucinated the entire thing, I would believe you, because surely, no real filmmakers could have done something this atrocious on purpose.

Final verdict: If you love yourself, avoid this film. If you hate someone, buy them a ticket. If you're looking for something magical, I suggest staring at a blank wall. It'll be more engaging than whatever this was.","You and 6 other people found this helpful.","6 people found this helpful."

I wish I could say it was simply disappointing, but that would imply it had any potential to begin with. This was an abysmal waste of time, money, and—most importantly—childhood wonder.

I took my goddaughter to see this, expecting at the very least a whimsical, enchanting reimagining of the beloved classic. Instead, we sat through nearly two hours of soulless dialogue, uninspired visuals, and characters so watered down and unrecognizable that by the time the credits rolled, she turned to me and said, “I don’t think I want to be a princess anymore.” That’s not just bad filmmaking—that’s cultural vandalism.

Guys, they were only five other people in the entire theater, and a couple left after the first 20 or so minutes, yeah.. that bad…I thought it might get better…nope…

Where do I even begin? The script is a disaster, attempting to modernize the story in a way that sucks out all the fun, romance and charm and replaces it with awkward, heavy-handed messaging. Snow White herself is neither relatable nor compelling, stripped of any warmth or charisma. The chemistry between characters is nonexistent, the humor falls flat, and the pacing is both sluggish and jarring. Even the visuals—a potential saving grace—fail to impress, burdened with cheap-looking CGI and a color palette that’s more dreary than dazzling.

Disney had every opportunity to create a fresh, imaginative retelling of a timeless story, but instead, they delivered a joyless, cynical, and utterly unnecessary film that betrays both its source material and the audience’s trust. There was no heart, no magic, and certainly no reason for this film to exist. If there were any justice, this entire project would have been scrapped before it ever made it to theaters.

I wouldn’t recommend Snow White (2025) to anyone—children, adults, or even those looking for a so-bad-it’s-good experience. It’s not even entertaining in its failure; it’s just bleak. If you love classic Disney, if you cherish good storytelling, or if you simply value your time, do yourself a favor and skip this cinematic disaster.","You and 8 other people found this helpful.","8 people found this helpful."

Disney’s new live-action adaptation of Snow White deeply distorts the original Grimm Brothers’ tale, first published in 1812 as ""Sneewittchen."" While adaptations can be modernized, they should not lose the story’s essence or cultural context.

Altered cultural identity

Snow White is a German princess with skin ""as white as snow,"" reflecting the beauty ideal of that era. In this version, the protagonist is Latina or mixed-race, severing ties with the character’s Germanic origin. It’s not about exclusion, but about respecting the story’s identity. If diversity is the goal, it would be far more meaningful to tell authentic stories from other cultures rather than rewriting existing ones.

Changed personality

In the original, Snow White is noble, humble, and grateful. Here, she acts arrogantly—after sleeping in the dwarfs’ home, she tells them to clean without expressing thanks. This contrasts with the classic version, where she earns their trust by cleaning the house before they arrive.

Mirror and message distortion

The iconic line ""Mirror, mirror on the wall..."" has been replaced by versions like ""Who is truly the fairest?"" This reflects a modern push for values like inner beauty or strength, but the change lacks depth or consistency and weakens one of the story’s most symbolic moments.

Prince removed

The prince is replaced by a thief who plays a secondary role. Snow White rescues him, and he reappears at the end merely as a dance partner. This shift undermines the original climax and turns the story into a disjointed tale.

Forced ideology

The film is heavily influenced by “Woke” ideology. Rather than telling a compelling story, it seems more focused on ticking ideological boxes. Snow White is now the sole hero, while classic characters are sidelined or altered beyond recognition.

A missed opportunity

Instead of reshaping beloved European tales, Disney could craft new stories inspired by real legends from Africa, Asia, or Latin America—where characters authentically reflect those cultures. That would offer genuine representation without erasing existing narratives.

Conclusion

This adaptation fails to respect the spirit or structure of the original tale. It changes the identity, values, and narrative for the sake of a poorly integrated message. The result is a confused, hollow version far removed from the timeless magic of the Brothers Grimm.","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

- Innovative artistry:  There is no innovative tech, or anything that pushes movie making forward.

- Emotional storytelling: While the singing is good enough to make you feel chills, in terms of story it just doesn't lands and feels emotionally flat. Maybe, grumpy amd sleepy get close to making you feel something, but it gets easily overshadow.

- Attention to detail: The dwarfs look creepy and also weird when they are next to Rachel Zegler. And the other sub plot with the 7 randoms just make you feel like this movie was chopped in post by executives who intervene in the creative process.

- Timeless appeal: The original was timeless theme, a kind hearted humble princess who was pretty on the inside and outside VS a jealous arrogant egocentric queen who was all about superficiality. This one is about a woman who wants to overthrow the government because she believes she is more kind than the queen. Very lazy and forgettable.

- Sense of wonder: No imagination, you don't feel like you are exploring something you haven't seen before, it doesn't spark that childlike curiosity and awe about things that aren't real, but could be plausible.

Disney DNA died in the 90s. Ever since then they have been culturally and creatively bankrupt, and only survived thanks to all the acquisitions of far more creative and imaginative studios which they gradually are turning to trash.

The original snow white is still remembered almost a century later whereas the new one will be forgotten a year from now.When people have to choose which one to watch, people will say ""let's watch the good one"" without specifying what the good one is, and yet everyone will instantly know what the good one is; the animated one.","You and 452 other people found this helpful.","452 people found this helpful."

2. Deviation from the Source Material – Key elements of the classic Snow White tale have been altered significantly, often in ways that seem forced rather than organic. This disrupts the integrity of the story and alienates fans of the original.


3. Woke Elements Over Substance – The film prioritizes modern ideological messaging over strong storytelling, character development, and thematic depth. While updates to classic tales can be meaningful, the execution here feels more like a checklist of current social trends rather than a well-crafted narrative.


4. Lack of Magic and Wonder – Classic Disney fairy tales are known for their enchanting atmosphere and timeless appeal. If the film is bogged down by contemporary reinterpretations that strip away its fairytale essence, it risks losing the very qualities that made Snow White an enduring story.

And this time, they chose the timeless classic, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"", one of the most groundbreaking, influential, and beloved pieces of animation ever created. It not only helped put Walt Disney and his studio on the map but even revolutionized the animation industry. It was also one of my all-time favorite Disney flicks growing up, so there’s is no way I'm the only one who feels his childhood was violated by this atrocious live-action adaptation, because the best way I can describe it is a hollow shell from which all the magic, wonder, and charm that made it so legendary in 1937 was torn out, and replaced with excessive political correctness, modernization, and feminism.

All the characters are flat as cardboard and almost completely lack their hand-drawn counterparts’ positive qualities. While the animated Snow White (Rachel Zegler) didn't have much personality to begin with, she's still noticeably remolded into a more modern tough and independent woman with ambition instead of the sweet, innocent yet naive damsel in distress we know and love. The prince, now named Jonathan (Andrew Burnap), is completely revamped as an unpleasant bandit leader who displays none of the original chemistry with Snow White. Consequently, their relationship comes off as very shallow and unmoving. The CGI models for the dwarves and animals were so uncanny and ugly looking, they undoubtedly scared any children who watched this. But Gal Gadot as the Queen was the worst of all. She may have looked the part with her wardrobe, but she had the screen presence and charisma of a log and had none of the menace that her animated counterpart delivered, as the queen or the old hag.

Most of the scenery is made up of garish and overused CGI that made the whole world look fake. The costumes and character models are overly bright and badly designed. The story is tweaked so much, it removes the emotional impact the original films’ most pivotal moments had, like Snow White biting the poisoned apple. Even the climatic ending where the evil queen falls to her death from a cliff is replaced by a disappointing showdown between her and Snow White where she's turned into glass after trying to smash the magic mirror. It’s all just so unfulfilling to watch.

And to put the cherry on the cake, the beloved songs are all warped with the addition of new, jarring lyrics or even outright replaced, like ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" being substituted with ""Waiting on a Wish"". Don't get me wrong, Rachel Zegler has a beautiful voice, is a talented singer, and played the cards Marc Webb dealt her as best she could, but she was clearly out of her element to be playing Snow White. And I'll admit, the original songs were far from bad, again thanks to Zeglers singing, but they still felt unnecessary and couldn't save this film.

No question, this was an unmitigated disaster that barely resembled the original film at all and feels like a slap in the face to Walt Disney's legacy.  He would roll in his grave if he could see this. No doubt, this will go down in history the biggest flop in the company’s history and definitely won't be doing Rachel Zegler or Gal Gadot’s career any favors.","You and 8 other people found this helpful.","8 people found this helpful."

Her arch enemy the evil Queen, dies in an accident while Snow White is unconscious. Lame.

The new version preserves all the magic and familiar moments of the original, but expands and develops both the storyline and Snow White's character to create something FAR more inspiring, dramatic and moving.

Visually, it is stunning. It maintains a gorgeous story book aesthetic throughout, every frame is a vision. The CGI dwarves were a controversial choice, but they're brilliantly executed and full of character and expression.

Zegler as Snow White is absolutely brilliant. She's feisty, adorable and a little goofy. Her vocals are beyond compare, and full of emotion. Best Snow White ever.

The handsome prince of earlier versions is dumped in favour of Jonathan (Andrew Burnap), a far more charismatic and likeable Robin Hood style character. He and the exiled Snow White find rebellious inspiration in each other as they fall in love.

The film builds to a far more satisfying climax as Snow White struggles to find the courage she was known for as a child, without the guidance and support of her parents, in world where all hope seems lost. She goes through a powerful development from fearful child to revolutionary leader, ready to fight for her beliefs and reclaim her throne. This is the thread at the core of the film.

This powerful, beautiful and inspiring film is the kind of thing kids need to be growing up with if our future is going to get any brighter.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

However I wish I had listened to other people before wasting my money in the Cinema… the hair and makeup for a start was absolutely shocking !! Costuming cheap and tacky !! Story line is nothing like the original infact it should be “ Snow Shite “ rather than “ Snow White “ what is so wrong with waiting for Prince Charming to save the day ? What is so wrong with falling in love. Something that really annoyed me that I have noticed not a lot of people talking about is Dopeys character … why is he so depressed and sad all the time ?where is his fun playful character ? And his iconic scenes from the original movie ? they ruined his character not to mention taking away opportunities from talented actors to create CGI in a “ live action remake “ makes 0 sense !! The fact there was no Prince and a “ bandit “ and they included one bandit actor who had dwarfism ? It was so random and strange the whole story line I hated all the songs again no original songs that everyone knows and loves . Only decent song was waiting on a wish which still didn’t blow me away . There was kids running round the cinema bored and my partner next to me fell asleep it was that boring . Also I love Gal Gadott she looked beautiful  ( more beautiful than Snow White herself ) but why have her singing ? This clearly was not her genre she should not of been singing I was cringing in my seat !! Again adding unnecessary things to the movie that does not make it better but only makes it worse !! 

Worst Disney movie I have ever watched !! I am a huge Disney fan and love all of the remakes especially the 2015 live action Cinderella they got it all right !! With this they have just wasted a lot of money and time !! Snow White gone Woke no thankyou !!! Don’t recommend as I said if I could this movie would be -0 stars !!

And Tinkerbell was in it!! That was such a cute surprise bc I love Tinkerbell. The seven dwarfs look like the original, there are scenes that flash you back to the original. Rachel shines so bright as Snow White, her voice is undeniably incredible. My daughter kept repeating on the way home, be fearless, be Fair, be Brave, be True. This movie was meant for her, a little girl who is learning how to find her voice. It's not for a grown adults weird expectations. The expectations grown adults are having for this movie meant for children is super weird. Bc my daughter loved it. 

This movie felt like they took the cartoon and brought it to life to me, which is what it is supposed to be, it's a live action, not a remake which I think ppls expectations cause them to miss the beauty and deeper message in these movies. They did the same with Mufasa.

I'm so lost at all the bad reviews, and they feel really forced, the movie came out yesterday and I think they already had their minds set to hate it. One said their 3 year old was bored, but it must be their first child bc 3 year olds do not sit through any movie. If you read them, they're pretty baseless.

My advice is to go into it with no expectations just truly wanting to have a good time and reminisce about the cartoon version. If you go in wanting Dune Part 2, or even Wicked, I'm so sorry it's quite literally a Disney children's movie, and it's literally one we have seen before.

I'm someone with a 6 year old daughter, and we have ap to Disney World so every other weekend we go to Magic Kingdom so we can ride the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, it's her absolute favorite ride and Snow White is her favorite princess. Her face lit up at the mine train scene, she screamed it's just like the ride!!! She was very loud in the theater with excitement and made everyone in the theater excited too. We sang our favorite songs that were still there from the original. We enjoyed the deeper back story of Snow White, even the small changes. Ppl say Gal Gadots performance was bad, I was waiting for something to back up that claim, she played it as well as anyone would play the evil queen to me. We see the evil queen all the time at Disney, it seemed accurate to me. She has an accent but if that's their problem with her then clearly that's crazy.

My daughter usually loves all the CHILDREN movies that these grown weird adults spend their time to review as bad and tbh I have no idea what they are wanting from these movies. Bc this one was exactly what I expected, I even cried at the end. It's someone else's movie that they made, not yours. You can go in your basement and make any Snow White movie you want lol but this one is how they wanted. Why can't we just watch the movie and enjoy it, especially since it's quite literally a princess fairytale movie for children, not for a grown man named Matt like wth are we doing rn.","You and 23 other people found this helpful.","23 people found this helpful."

We'll, having seen it twice, once in IMAX, all I can say is that this film is a delight to the imagination, and the eyes and ears. Zegler is a lovely and gifted young woman. The dwarfs were great: I'm not sure why critic's and everyone else alike were so offended by the CGI dwarfs----after the endless exposure to CGI now for what, 40 years practically, I couldn't understand the frothing at the mouth over the dwarfs. Yes, it was a bit updated-----but so what? Have you seen the 1937 animated classic lately? I couldn't sit through a slavishly faithful carbon copy of it-----unless I wanted the helium-voiced version of Snow White again. Nor did I want the Kristin Stewart ""update"", which I rather enjoyed but which paled in comparison to this current one.  
I know I'm in a minority, but it was a family-friendly delight, and I find it regrettable when we're all expected to be in either lock-step devotion to or revulsion at a film or actor due the woke meter in use at the moment. If you want an enjoyable couple hours escapist fare that tells a good simple tale of good and evil, then take a chance on Snow White.","You and 7 other people found this helpful.","7 people found this helpful."

the 1 star reviews are hilarious. this movie has a new snow white yes, and there is also love. why are people saying 'empowering women' and 'doesn't need a man' SHE LITERALLY FALLS IN LOVE. you can tell these brain dead clowns never watched it or saw the message of kindness or looking into people's hearts through their eyes. remembering people's names.

she's not 'empowering' she is kind, she knows everyone by name and her parents are the kingdom's fighting force. every character was believable for me and stuck to their character.

the huntsman saved her, when he didn't know what was going to happen to him. the queen opens the chest not to find her heart, but an apple. when the huntsman was brought to the queen, he only asked that she spare snow white.

the thieves believed in the king, Johnathan believed in kindness but he also believed in saving himself and his crew. snow white did not save him, never, she helped. he saved her and almost died. she taught him something but also helped him.

they're not just men, they're loyal people to the kingdom. she's not just a fair princess, she is someone who wants to learn how to lead the only way she knows.

personally, I was fine with the actual little person playing one of the thieves, it was funny compared to the cgi dwarves. not everyone will like the characteristics of the cgi dwarves but I liked them and they all did their part, they became a troop and a family. when grumpy cried the most at her funeral it made sense because she was the first to listen to him after 274 years and never wanted to change them. despite their differences they could unite. they stayed by her for days after they thought she died.

snow white rallies her people by calling each gaurd by name and reminding them of their kindness.

Snow White (2023) is a cinematic disaster that not only fails to honor its source material but actively dismantles everything that made the original 1937 Disney classic so beloved. This reimagining is a prime example of how modern filmmakers can take a timeless fairy tale and strip it of its magic, charm, and coherence in the name of ""progress"" or ""modernization."" The result is a hollow, self-indulgent mess that betrays the heart of the story and alienates both longtime fans and newcomers alike.
The Plot: A Betrayal of the Original Story

The most egregious sin of this adaptation is its complete disregard for the original plot. Gone is the enchanting tale of a young princess, her wicked stepmother, and the seven dwarfs who become her unlikely protectors. Instead, we are subjected to a convoluted narrative that tries to be everything at once—a feminist manifesto, a political allegory, and a gritty fantasy epic—but succeeds at none of it.

    Snow White as a Warrior Princess: In this version, Snow White is no longer the kind, innocent girl who finds solace in the kindness of strangers. Instead, she’s a sword-wielding, battle-hardened warrior who spends more time delivering cringe-worthy monologues about ""breaking the patriarchy"" than she does embodying the gentle spirit of the original character. This drastic shift in her personality robs the story of its emotional core. Snow White’s innocence and vulnerability were what made her relatable and endearing; here, she’s just another generic action heroine.

    The Dwarfs? What Dwarfs?: Perhaps the most baffling change is the treatment of the seven dwarfs. In a misguided attempt to avoid stereotypes, the filmmakers have completely reimagined them as a group of ""magical creatures"" of varying heights and genders. While diversity is commendable, this decision strips the dwarfs of their individuality and charm. Doc, Grumpy, Happy, and the rest are no longer the lovable, quirky characters we grew up with; they’re now generic sidekicks with no distinct personalities or meaningful roles in the story.

 The Themes: Heavy-Handed and Unsubtle

The film’s attempts to modernize the story are so heavy-handed that they border on parody. Every other scene feels like a lecture on gender equality, environmentalism, or social justice, with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. While these themes are important, they are clumsily inserted into the narrative, often at the expense of character development and plot coherence. The result is a story that feels more like a checklist of contemporary issues than a cohesive fairy tale.


This Snow White adaptation is a prime example of how not to modernize a classic.","You and 113 other people found this helpful.","113 people found this helpful."

The recent outrage and bad reviews are justified and accurate. After suffering through the 1 hour and 49 minutes of woke agenda portrayed in a Disney classic i can honestly say do not watch it. 

Creative Shortcomings:
Narrative and Character Changes: The film introduces a more assertive Snow White, portrayed by Rachel Zegler, who actively opposes the Evil Queen's tyranny alongside a Robin Hood-like figure named Jonathan. This departure from the traditional storyline was met with disapproval from audiences who favored the original's simplicity. ​

Portrayal of the Dwarfs: 
In an attempt to address past criticisms, the film opts for CGI representations of the seven dwarfs instead of casting actors with dwarfism. This choice was perceived as a half-hearted solution, failing to satisfy advocates for authentic representation. ​

Weak Villain: 
Gal Gadot's depiction of the Evil Queen lacked the menace of the original animated character, rendering her more petty than threatening. This diminished the film's dramatic tension and failed to provide a compelling antagonist for Snow White.

Box Office Disappointment: 
Opening with just $43 million and experiencing a sharp decline to $14.2 million in its second week, the film's earnings totaled $145 million worldwide against a $270 million budget, resulting in a substantial financial loss. ​

Impact on Future Projects:
The underperformance led Disney to pause its live-action remake of ""Tangled,"" reflecting a reevaluation of their strategy for reimagining animated classics. ​


In summary, Disney's ""Snow White"" remake faltered due to its controversial creative decisions and poor financial returns, prompting the company to reassess its approach to live-action adaptations.​ Keep the remakes true to the original film's. 9/10 movies that have a remake that features true deviation from the original story line or it's characters fail immensely!","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

From the opening frame, it’s clear this isn’t a reimagining—it’s a butchering. The classic tale, once a timeless gem of innocence and wonder, has been gutted, stripped of its soul, and draped in a cheap, garish veneer of modern pretension that collapses under its own weight.
Let’s start with the script, if you can call it that—a disjointed mess of clunky dialogue and half-baked ideas that stumbles over itself like a drunk toddler. Every line feels focus-grouped to death, oozing with forced empowerment tropes that ring hollow and patronizing. Snow White herself? Forget the gentle strength of the original. Here, she’s a shrill, unlikeable caricature, barking orders and swinging a sword with all the grace of a malfunctioning Roomba. The dwarves—oh, the poor dwarves—are reduced to a cringe-inducing sideshow, their charm replaced with gimmicky quirks that feel like rejected sitcom pitches. And the Evil Queen? A cardboard cutout with no menace, no depth—just a loud costume and a pout.
The visuals are a nauseating assault. The CGI looks like it was rendered on a budget laptop, with forests so fake they’d embarrass a high school play and a color palette that screams “Instagram filter gone wrong.” The direction is aimless, lurching from one bloated set piece to the next with no coherence or heart. The songs—once the backbone of the story—are either butchered into forgettable pop drivel or axed entirely, leaving a void where emotion should be.
Worst of all, it’s painfully clear this film hates its own legacy. It sneers at the fairy tale’s simplicity, trading whimsy for cynicism and magic for lectures. It’s not just bad—it’s spiteful, a middle finger to anyone who loved the original. Watching it feels like being trapped in a room with a smug know-it-all who’s wrong about everything but won’t shut up. Save your money, your time, and your sanity. This Snow White deserves to be buried in the deepest, darkest forest and forgotten forever.","You and 8 other people found this helpful.","8 people found this helpful."

And don’t even get me *started* on the Seven Dwarfs, or should I say, the “Diverse Magnificent Seven” 😭  
Bro, it’s like the casting director spun a diversity wheel and said:  
> ""Okay let’s get a dwarf, a tall guy, a short queen, someone non-binary, a background character from *Encanto*, and sprinkle in random extras just to hit every checkbox!""  
Where’s the charm? Where’s the brotherhood? Nah bro, this ain’t no brotherhood—it’s a *focus group* on screen.

The Evil Queen? Ohhh man. Back in the day, she was vain and power-hungry, classic villain energy. Now? She’s basically a misunderstood ""girlboss"" who’s mad because *patriarchy* told her beauty was her only worth. Like, are you serious?  
It's like they wanted her to go full LinkedIn influencer:  
> “Hi, I’m the Evil Queen, and today I’ll teach you how to slay your inner beauty standards and gaslight your way to the top! 💼✨”  
Bruh. *Stop the madness.*

The Prince? LMAO. What prince? Oh wait, there *is* a prince, but they neutered my boy so hard he might as well be her emotional support hamster.  
He’s just there. Breathing oxygen. Dropping one or two lines. No personality. Zero rizz. If this dude tried to kiss her awake, she’d probably file a restraining order for ""non-consensual affection."" 😂

And the script… holy mother of bad writing.  
The lines are so forced, so *painfully* on the nose, it’s like they fed ChatGPT a list of woke Twitter hashtags and told it to freestyle. Every time a character opens their mouth, it’s like:  
> ""I'm not waiting for a prince. I'm saving *myself*.""  
Like girl, we get it. You’re independent. But could you maybe slay the dragon *first*, then give us your TED Talk later? Damn. 🐉

Visually, I’ll give them this: the CGI’s alright. Looks kinda pretty. But it’s like polishing a turd, bro. You can add all the sparkle you want, but this movie still stinks like a gender studies professor's final exam. 💩✨

And you know what’s wild? I came into this with *hope*. For real. I thought, maybe, *maybe* they’ll respect the old magic. But nah. They wanted to kill the vibe and give us a checklist movie for corporate virtue signaling.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Yes, the CGI dwarves were kinda uncalled for seeing how it could have been a good opportunity for actors with dwarfism. The only other thing that I disliked was the Dopey talked, which yet again, wasn't horrible. The prince in the original isn't a ""stalker"", but he didn't know Snow White. He met her once and then they married... Johnathan on the other hand bonded with Snow White throughout the movie. The cgi was good! This movie made me feel the magic that Disney brings to families. I watched this with my family and we all laughed at the jokes, loved the singing (especially Zegler), and the choreography.

This is what chat got had to say about it;

The upcoming Snow White live-action remake has sparked significant controversy, primarily due to its drastic changes from the original 1937 Disney classic. While adaptations often introduce new elements, this film appears to prioritize modern political messaging over respecting the timeless story that audiences have cherished for generations. The most glaring issue is the decision to cast a Latina actress, Rachel Zegler, as Snow White—a character whose very name and identity are rooted in her fair complexion. This choice feels less like a creative decision and more like an attempt to push a progressive agenda at the expense of the story’s integrity.

Snow White is a German fairy tale, and her defining characteristic is her “skin as white as snow,” as described in the Brothers Grimm version. Changing her ethnicity alters a fundamental aspect of the character, raising the question of why Disney insists on remaking classics while simultaneously rejecting what made them iconic in the first place. Instead of creating new, diverse fairy tales, the company seems intent on retroactively modifying existing ones to fit modern ideological narratives.

Beyond the casting controversy, the film’s overall approach appears to dismiss the core themes of the original. Zegler herself has made statements criticizing the classic Snow White story, calling it outdated and problematic. This disregard for the original material, combined with the replacement of the Seven Dwarfs with a more “inclusive” group, further alienates longtime fans. Rather than celebrating the beloved legacy of Disney animation, the remake seems focused on deconstructing it.

Ultimately, this new Snow White is yet another example of Hollywood’s obsession with virtue signaling at the cost of storytelling. Instead of forcing progressive changes onto classic tales, studios should invest in original narratives that authentically represent diversity without erasing what made these stories special.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

The changes made for this adaptation are reasonable, but perhaps not thought out as much as they should have been. Zeigler is passable as Snow White. While she can sing with the best of them, her acting at times is wooden, as if she is just reading the lines. Gal Gadot is miscast as the Evil Queen. While she brings beauty to the role, she plays the villain over the top. I would have liked to see her play the role more serious and threatening. The seven dwarfs have an uncanny valley look to them, but that disappears as the movie goes on and they do bring a few laughs along the way. Kudos to Pasek and Paul for doing their best to create a modern musical from the original. “Good Things Grow” is a bop and their rework of “Whistle While You Work” and “Heigh-Ho” are terrific. The rest of the music for the film is forgettable. The rework of the love interest seemed unnecessary, but they made it work. The ending was not satisfying, extra characters seemed to weigh down the movie and the choreography was horrible and uninteresting to watch. If you go into this film with the goal of hate, you will find plenty to justify that feeling.

Every decision behind this upcoming disaster feels like a slap in the face to anyone with even a shred of common sense. From its misguided attempt at “modernization” to the painfully miscast lead, this film is shaping up to be an unwatchable mess that nobody asked for.

Let’s talk about Rachel Zegler, because unfortunately, we have to. Somehow, Disney thought it was a good idea to cast an actress who clearly hates the very movie she’s starring in. Instead of promoting the film with even a little bit of respect, Zegler has spent her time whining about how outdated the original story is—despite willingly signing up to play the lead. The way she talks about Snow White, you’d think she was being forced at gunpoint to wear the dress. Her interviews drip with the kind of smug, self-righteous energy that makes you want to root for the Evil Queen instead.

And speaking of bad choices, let’s talk about the so-called “dwarfs.” Except, oh wait—there are barely any. Instead of the seven iconic characters, Disney has replaced them with a bizarre group of CGI-lite randos that look like they walked out of a rejected Lord of the Rings spin-off. But hey, at least they didn’t go full live-action Cats, so I guess that’s the one tiny mercy.

Then there’s the story, which has been “updated” for modern audiences. Translation: they gutted everything remotely fairy tale-like and replaced it with a dull, sanitized, corporate-approved checklist of “strong female lead” clichés. Snow White doesn’t need a prince, she doesn’t need dwarfs, and honestly, she doesn’t even seem to need a personality. What we’re left with is a joyless, soulless husk of a film that exists solely to check boxes rather than tell a compelling story.

Disney had one job: remake a beloved classic with a little more polish. Instead, they’ve given us a lead actress who loathes the material, a supporting cast that barely exists, and a version of the story so sanitized and focus-grouped that it might as well have been written by an AI programmed to remove fun. At this point, the only thing left to hope for is that the poisoned apple gets passed around to everyone involved in making this disaster happen.","You and 33 other people found this helpful.","33 people found this helpful."

Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen is undeniably captivating—she steals every scene she’s in. The cinematography and costume design are gorgeous, and the musical numbers, while different from the classic film, have their own charm.

That said, the film does struggle in some areas. The CGI dwarfs don’t quite have the same personality as the original characters, and some of the story changes feel forced rather than organic. The attempt to modernize Snow White’s journey is admirable, but at times, it feels like it’s trying too hard to distance itself from the classic fairy tale.

Overall, while Snow White (2025) has its moments—especially in its performances and visuals—it doesn’t quite reach the heights of Disney’s best live-action remakes.

The animated one has its place in the annals of moviemaking, this one is entertaining (mind you not a masterpiece, not Oscar material and not a top 10 movie of the year) but not one-star affair as people tend to make it. It has its moments (love the opening song by Ziegler), love the look of Gal as the Evil Queen. I understand what they were doing with the look of the seven dwarfs, but I guess the technology is not there yet and looked funny and not charming as the animated film.  Ziegler is not charismatic nor one who captures the scenes or steals it (that show of showmanship goes to Gadot). That all being said, there’s movies that should never be remade because of their “classic” tag, thus making it impossible to be objective and detached from their original title (Star Wars, citizen Kane or Casablanca comes to mind), but based on this entry of Snow White, I’ll say that is a nice movie and one that could be watch one time, but it is not one that you’ll be rewatching a thousand times like the original.

This remake not only tarnishes the legacy of the 1937 animated classic but also stands as a glaring example of how misguided modern adaptations can be. ￼ ￼

Rachel Zegler’s portrayal of Snow White is a rare glimmer of competence in this otherwise dismal production. Her vocal talents are undeniable, breathing some semblance of life into an otherwise lifeless script. However, even her commendable efforts are insufficient to salvage a film so deeply flawed at its core.  ￼

Gal Gadot’s casting as the Evil Queen is nothing short of a casting catastrophe. Her performance lacks the depth and menace required for such an iconic villain, rendering her portrayal as flat and uninspired. This miscasting is emblematic of the film’s broader issues—a fundamental misunderstanding of what made the original so enchanting.  ￼

The film’s attempt to modernize the narrative with pseudo-progressive elements is both clumsy and condescending. Instead of empowering the titular character, these additions feel like hollow gestures, stripping away the timeless charm of the original story. The result is a disjointed mess that fails to resonate on any meaningful level.

Visually, “Snow White” is an overproduced eyesore. The excessive use of CGI creates a world that feels artificial and soulless, lacking the handcrafted beauty of traditional animation. The Seven Dwarfs, reimagined through motion capture, are particularly unsettling, embodying the film’s misguided reliance on technology over storytelling.

Critics have rightly panned this travesty. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described it as “exhaustingly awful,” criticizing the film’s “agobiantes añadidos pseudo-progresistas” and lamenting the wasted talent of its lead actresses.  Similarly, Johnny Oleksinski of the New York Post dismissed it as “another autómata de acción real inútil y extraño,” highlighting its failure to justify its existence.  ￼

In conclusion, Disney’s “Snow White” is a soulless cash grab that desecrates a beloved classic. It serves as a stark reminder that not all stories need to be retold, especially when the retelling lacks the heart, magic, and integrity of the original. Audiences would be wise to avoid this cinematic poison apple. ￼","You and 88 other people found this helpful.","88 people found this helpful."

Now, RACHEL!!! Absolutely loved her in this! Her acting and singing outshone almost everyone (her male co-star was such a great singer and their love song was so sweet.)

I do think the costuming and hair department fumbled with her hair… I don’t know why they chose to part her hair down the middle when it looked so cute in the few scenes it had a side part. I blame current hair trends that makes Disney put every single princess with a middle part.

The CGI wasn’t bad, but I do think it would have been better to cast people with dwarfism as the main dwarves, though there were other actors with dwarfism in the movie. I found dopey to be very cute, but it gives uncanny valley to see a character that’s meant to look human but “enlarged.”

I found the movie funny and it made me realize why younger me liked the animated movie; something I barely remember cause I always name Ariel (and specifically Melody) as my favorite princess when I was a child.

The movie felt hopeful and inspiring. It focused on themes on being fair and kind, building community, and standing up for yourself and others.","You and 19 other people found this helpful.","19 people found this helpful."

This film strips away the charm, innocence, and timeless magic of the 1937 original, replacing it with bland performances, uninspired visuals, and a script that seems more focused on making a statement than telling a heartfelt fairy tale.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the warmth and whimsy of the original character, delivering a performance that feels more like a rebellious teenager than the kindhearted princess generations grew up with. The reworked story removes much of the original's charm, opting for modern messaging over classic storytelling. And don’t even get me started on the dwarfs—or rather, the bizarre attempt to replace them with something entirely different, which only ends up feeling awkward and forced.

Visually, the film is forgettable, with CGI that somehow looks worse than movies made a decade ago. The once-enchanting world of Snow White is now dull and lifeless, devoid of the artistry that made Disney's first animated feature so iconic. Even the Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot, comes across as more campy than menacing, making her a weak villain compared to her animated counterpart.

Disney had the perfect opportunity to bring Snow White to life in a way that honored the original while adding depth to the story. Instead, they delivered a joyless, creatively bankrupt mess that nobody asked for. If you love the original, do yourself a favor—skip this one and rewatch the classic instead.","You and 11 other people found this helpful.","11 people found this helpful."

I understand that the OG Snow White is super high-pitched, and possibly annoying, but she was at least light and soft, and gentle on her delivery. Rachel was just... Rachel, lol. She didn't exude an inherent kindness I felt, and instead was just... herself? I wasn't buying her as a kind royal. 

Gal Gadot looked awesome as the evil queen, but her acting too I just wasn't buying... she sounded one-note the whole time, and I didn't feel that she was actually enraged or upset at Snow White. 

Musically, the new songs are terrible. If you think OneRepublic or any other corny musicians of the day make superb music, then you'll definitely be jamming to the new songs. But if you appreciate actual music and melodies, then you'll find them to be jarring with the era SW takes place in. The OG songs are super fun and make you smile (Whistle While You Work and Heigh Ho), but otherwise, it's a mixed bag of boring vanilla ice cream. 

Glad I saw a matinee to save a few bucks on this. Overall, I'd say wait until it's on D+ instead of going to the theatre. Either way, enjoy Disney's most expensive remake - yikes!","You and 21 other people found this helpful.","21 people found this helpful."

Because her family was poor when she was a child, she couldn’t even afford proper food and had to eat potatoes every day.

She grew up malnourished, with sallow skin and ill-fitting clothes. On the day they immigrated to the United States, the sky began to fall with pure white snow.

From then on, everyone affectionately called her Snow White.

In contrast, the Queen was truly wicked. She kept all the good things for herself — eating the finest food, becoming plump and radiant, with smooth white skin and a curvy figure that clearly revealed some questionable “ingredients.”

Every move and every gesture reeked of old capitalist arrogance.

Later on, Snow White began fighting for the rights of her people. She told the Queen:
""You should share more of the pie with the common people.""

The stepmother replied:
""How can we let them eat something as delicious as pie? That would only confuse them.""

Although the princess was rejected, she continued to hold onto her ideals, enduring hardship and exhaustion. In the end, her little face was worn down from the struggle.

And then, the stepmother started to envy her. If you think she was jealous of Snow White’s beauty, then you’re too shallow!

She envied Snow White’s fortune — her humble, natural origins and the powerful proletarian aura she radiated!

Looking at her own flaming red lips, the Queen realized they were utterly incompatible with the stance of class struggle. Furious, she expelled Snow White from the palace.

But even that wasn’t enough to quell her anger. She loudly asked the magic mirror:
""Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the most politically correct person of all?""

The mirror hesitated and said:
""It used to be you. But now, it’s that young girl called Snow White.""

The Queen covered her face and wept bitterly. She couldn’t believe she had fallen behind the times — that it was her outdated thinking that had left her behind!

Meanwhile, the aura Snow White exuded attracted everyone eager to transform their thinking — every young person yearning for progress!

Thus, the prince was deeply drawn to her. He loathed his own pale skin, hated his symmetrical facial features, and fell madly in love with Snow White.

As long as she didn’t despise him, he was willing to follow her to the ends of the earth!

And so, with the right timing, the right people, and the right circumstances, Snow White finally defeated her stepmother and climbed onto the grand stage of history.

From then on, she and the prince lived happily ever after in great national unity. Confetti!!!","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

Modern ideals ig..but...the movie badly thrown together, with broken concepts and modern bs it's practically unwatchable, just on those levels, 

And Rachel had a lot of work to do to win people over as it was, as she didn't fit the role to the point they had to literally change the origin of her characters name, 

And Gal gadot is an amazing actress but an evil queen she is not asmuch as she obviously had fun in the role (which made the movie have enjoyable parts) she struggles to potray evil intent very well she's too much of a kind mother and it shows through her fake evil she should stick to being the good guy or the kind baddie,...and they used some very odd editing choices towards her character like what was with that every angle scene, but....her costume was pretty much the most amazing costume in the whole movie and very accurate too bad she was still stunning in it,

Rachel zeglars costume and hair deserves the  memes of a certain short lord, they even took his white outfit, 

The magical creatures the CGI was awful least it was a good change from the original promo stuff but still missed the mark due to political bs..come on let dwarfs be dwarves, you could have just updated their back story away from them being fairy tale creatures and humanise them and have them as just people with dwarfism who have to be minors to make a living but whilst still staying true to the story we Don't need weird broken political narratives in stuff to be aimed at kids, 

As much as I enjoyed some parts it wasn't snow white, the evil queen was too beautiful, the weird twisted versions of stuff like it being kindness...spesh when the stepmom queen was practically the 2nd kindest person..and she's literally trying to kill ppl...how evil is everyone else in the world 😂, and changing the name reason to a snow storm.

a Very unwatchable, worse than Velma or Dragonball evolution la,

Only reason I watched was to see if gal's profomance was bad...it wasn't she rocked, but definitely can't do evil it comes off as cartoon evil or a parent pretending to be evil for a child's enjoyment, for that reason I'm still a gal gadot fan she almost saves this movie,

Maybe do a miss understood villain movie and have her play the evil queen in that it might fit her vibe more being the good bad guy,","You and 6 other people found this helpful.","6 people found this helpful."

The new songs don't have quite the same bite as the original songs but the direction allows all of the songs to shine in their own way. 

The cast do their best to play against type with Gal Gaddot commanding the screen whenever she appears. Her take on the Wicked Queen is not that far removed from the animated version in the 1937 movie. Nor is Snow White herself. 

There are some modernisation to the story, allowing for Snow White to forge her own destiny but there is still plenty of room for romance and they don't feminise the film to the point where it is unrecognisable. There is still a need for elements of the original movie, though the Prince has now become a folklore hero of a different type. 

The CGI dwarfs are incredible. No, they're not human beings. I hear the argument for giving work to actors but it's far from the only film that creates characters from CGI. At least these ones are engaging, colourful and representative of the original characterisations. 

I don't much care to know what the actress playing Snow White thinks of Trump, or politics, or how dated she thinks the old version of this story is. The fact that the story leans on the animated movie so heavily as its source shows the reverence from the filmmakers. One young woman's opinion should not distract from that.

Rachel Zegler’s Snow White is a mixed bag—her singing voice is undeniably impressive, but the character’s “modernized” arc as a wannabe revolutionary feels forced and preachy, like a lecture on empowerment nobody asked for. Gone is the gentle innocence of the original; instead, we get a princess who spends more time spouting platitudes than actually connecting with the story.

Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen is an even bigger letdown. She looks the part, sure, but her performance is stiff as a board, and her singing is so flat it’s almost comical—like someone forgot to tell her this was a musical. The new songs by Pasek and Paul? Forgettable at best, cringe-worthy at worst. They’re tacked on like an afterthought, lacking the heart of classics like “Someday My Prince Will Come”—which, oh yeah, they axed because apparently it’s too “dated” for 2025’s sensibilities.

And don’t get me started on the dwarfs. The CGI versions are a creepy, uncanny-valley mess—less endearing companions and more like rejected video game characters. The decision to sideline real actors for this feels like a half-baked attempt to dodge controversy, and it just doesn’t work. The plot tries to juggle a rebellion subplot that’s as generic as it gets, bogging down the pacing and making the whole thing feel like a slog. Visually, it’s a mishmash of over-saturated colors and fake-looking sets that scream “shot on a soundstage” rather than “enchanted forest.”

Let’s start with the obvious: this film hates its own legacy. It rips out the heart of the original and replaces it with a smug, self-important lecture on modern womanhood, delivered by a lead who appears to resent every second she’s on screen. Any charm, any whimsy, any magic that once defined this tale is buried beneath concrete messaging and CGI gloss.

Rachel Zegler, usually radiant, is shackled by a script so terrified of femininity it forgets Snow White is meant to be… likeable. Vulnerability is replaced with passive aggression. Kindness becomes arrogance in disguise. Her every line drips with contempt — for the dwarfs, the prince, the audience. It’s less a performance, more a TED Talk on how fairy tales should be ashamed of themselves.

The dwarfs? Gone. Replaced with an indistinct band of “forest people” whose dialogue could’ve been generated by a malfunctioning AI. The evil queen? Wasted. Gal Gadot pouts and struts, but the film won’t let her have any real menace — villains, like fun, are out of fashion. As for the prince… well, he’s barely allowed to exist. Romance? Banned. Charm? Illegal. Chemistry? Extinct.

Visually, the film is a dull parade of corporate-approved diversity and grey-tinted fantasy sludge. Every scene looks like it was rendered at gunpoint in a Disney boardroom. The forest doesn’t feel alive, the castle has no soul, and the “magic mirror” reflects nothing but the studio’s fear of offending literally anyone.

Snow White (2025) is not a movie — it’s an apology. A desperate attempt to correct what no one asked to be corrected. It rewrites a story that never needed fixing, strips it of wonder, and expects applause simply for existing.

There is no “happily ever after” here. Just credits rolling over the cold corpse of a story that once believed in love, kindness, and fantasy. In 2025, Snow White doesn’t dream — she lectures. And the mirror doesn’t lie: this is the ugliest remake of them all.

The casting of Rachel Zegler as Snow White, while showcasing a talented performer, turns the character into a sort of edgy modern feminist figure. Her insistence that Snow White is not waiting to be rescued by a prince comes off more as a clumsy lecture than a natural evolution of the character. It seems as if Disney decided that instead of letting the classic fairy tale speak for itself, they needed to inject a contemporary agenda that ultimately dilutes the story’s original innocence.

Then there is the baffling decision regarding the dwarfs. Replacing them with CGI ""magical creatures"" rather than casting real little people not only makes the characters look like cheap lawn gnomes but also avoids giving real actors a chance. This visual choice undermines the film’s credibility and makes what should be a whimsical part of the story look off-putting and inauthentic.

Marc Webb’s direction leaves much to be desired. The pacing feels uneven, and the narrative is padded with extra songs that try too hard to modernize old tunes. The tone swings awkwardly between trying to be progressive and clinging to nostalgic elements, so that even the genuinely emotional moments get lost in all the extra mess.

Overall, Disney’s ""Snow White"" comes across as a disappointing exercise in corporate reworking. It feels as if the studio, worried about repeating past mistakes, has lost its creative spark. Instead of letting a classic fairy tale shine on its own, they have imposed a particular perspective that ends up alienating both longtime fans and new audiences.

This so-called ""reimagining"" strips away everything that made the original magical, replacing it with a bland, joyless narrative that lacks charm, whimsy, and—most importantly—heart.

From the moment the film begins, it’s clear that the creative team had little interest in honoring the legacy of Disney’s first animated masterpiece. The absence of key elements, including the iconic dwarfs (replaced by a bafflingly odd group of generic characters), leaves the film feeling disconnected from its roots. Meanwhile, Snow White herself, once a symbol of kindness and innocence, is transformed into a character so far removed from her original essence that she might as well be someone else entirely.

The visuals, while technically polished, feel lifeless and uninspired, a far cry from the rich, hand-drawn artistry that made the 1937 classic so enchanting. The music is forgettable, the humor falls flat, and the story—despite its attempts to modernize—is devoid of the emotional depth that made the original resonate across generations.

But perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this film is that it seems ashamed of its source material. Rather than celebrating the wonder of Snow White, it actively distances itself from what made the story special in the first place. If the filmmakers didn’t respect the original, why even bother making this movie?

Disney has delivered some incredible live-action remakes in the past, but this is not one of them. Instead, it serves as a cautionary tale about what happens when studios prioritize corporate-driven ""updates"" over genuine storytelling. Fans of the original will likely leave the theater disappointed, wondering why they didn’t just stay home and rewatch the true classic.","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

Disney’s Snow White (2025) is one of the most controversial live-action remakes to date, and after watching it, I can see why. While I had no particular expectations going in—nor any strong feelings about Rachel Zegler’s involvement—I found the film to be a disappointing reimagining of the classic tale.

Visuals and Costuming

One of the biggest letdowns was Snow White’s styling. Her hairstyle did not suit her at all, making her look unflattering on screen. The iconic dress, meant to be a nod to the 1937 animated classic, appeared cheaply made and lacked the elegance of the original. Instead of elevating the character’s appearance, it had the opposite effect, making her look out of place rather than like a princess.

Casting and Character Portrayals

Rachel Zegler as Snow White simply did not fit the character. The name Snow White is meant to reflect the character’s fair complexion, red lips, and raven-black hair—key elements missing from this adaptation. While diversity in casting is welcome in new stories, changing fundamental aspects of a beloved character feels forced rather than natural.

The dwarves, a crucial part of the original story, were underwhelming. The heavy CGI made it hard to distinguish one from the other, and they lacked the charm that made them memorable. Dopey speaking was an odd choice, and his exaggerated ears made him look less endearing. Instead of feeling whimsical, the dwarves came across as generic CGI creatures with little personality.

The Evil Queen and Musical Numbers

Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen had potential, but her singing performance was awkward and cringeworthy. Rather than evoking the sinister elegance of the original villain, the scene felt unintentionally comedic, making it hard to take the character seriously.

Final Thoughts

Overall, Snow White (2025) feels like a misguided attempt at modernizing a timeless fairy tale. The visual choices, from Snow White’s styling to the overuse of CGI, detract from the film rather than enhance it. The movie lacks the magic, charm, and elegance that made the original an enduring classic. Instead of being an enchanting reimagining, it feels more like a parody, leaving me with secondhand embarrassment rather than wonder.

Unless you're curious about the controversy, this is one Disney remake that may not be worth your time.

I would say what people are really angry about regarding this film, is the lack of taking a chance on discovering new story lines, that and the artistic links mirroring an evil having power over innocence.
I would say that this is actually a good film, it is probably a 3.8 so I would give it a chance for the 7 dwarfs if nothing else.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

As a young adult who grew up on the original, I went into this movie with my own expectations—and I know I’m not alone in that. While it’s far from a perfect film, I genuinely believe it was unfairly hated. It wasn’t fabulous, but it wasn’t a complete disaster either.

The songs were underwhelming. But considering how few there were in the original—and how long ago it was made—it’s not easy to write new music that fits the tone while still feeling authentic. I don’t think the soundtrack quite landed, but I can see that they tried.

Casting is a mixed bag. Like many others, I had issues, but I want to emphasize that Rachel Zegler did a great job capturing Snow White’s kindness and innocence. She’s clearly a talented actress. While I understand the desire to stay faithful to the original character’s appearance, Rachel didn’t deserve the level of hate she received. The decisions about the film’s direction weren’t hers to make, and she shouldn’t be blamed. The same goes for Gal Gadot. I don’t think it helped that both actresses were let down by costume and hair design.

The seven dwarves were, however, a real misstep. The animation was rough, and their portrayal felt shallow and cartoonish (in a bad way). That part definitely needed more care and respect.

That said, I tried to consider how the movie might be viewed through the eyes of a child—who is, after all, the target audience. From that angle, the film works better. There are adorable woodland animals, bright visuals, and silly, fun moments that would absolutely appeal to younger viewers who aren’t concerned with accuracy to the source material or the online discourse.

Before the movie came out, I had heard that the prince wouldn’t be saving Snow White and that she would save herself. While I’m fully in support of female independence, I also like the romantic rescue—so I went in expecting disappointment. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that true love’s kiss still saved the day.

In short: not great, not awful. It has heart, but also a lot of flaws. It didn’t deserve the level of malice it got.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Snow White (2025) is not merely a bad movie—it is an abominable, joy-draining black hole of cinematic incompetence, an insufferable amalgamation of hubristic revisionism, artistic sterility, and narrative incoherence that assaults the senses with all the grace of a sledgehammer to the skull.

From its opening moments, this debacle showcases an unparalleled commitment to butchering a beloved classic, stripping it of any semblance of charm, wonder, or narrative cohesion. The writing is an insipid mess, utterly bereft of wit, emotional depth, or even the most rudimentary understanding of storytelling. Every line of dialogue is delivered with the lifeless enthusiasm of a hostage reading from a ransom note, and the characters—if one could even call these hollow, soulless approximations “characters”—possess all the warmth and depth of a damp cardboard cutout.

The film’s visual design, rather than capturing the ethereal magic of a timeless fairy tale, instead resembles the result of a budget-starved theme park attraction designed by a committee of joyless bureaucrats. The cinematography is a migraine-inducing parade of garish color grading, lifeless set pieces, and CGI so ghastly it would have been deemed unacceptable even in the early 2000s. It is a visual atrocity that actively repels the eye, an aesthetic war crime against good taste.

And the performances—oh, the performances. Never before has an ensemble cast so collectively failed to convey a single believable emotion. The lead actress, tasked with embodying one of the most iconic fairy tale figures in history, instead delivers a performance so staggeringly devoid of charm, charisma, or even the barest hint of likability that she single-handedly transforms the character into an insufferable, self-righteous bore. The supporting cast fares no better, delivering their lines with the passion and energy of a community theater production on the brink of collapse.

But worst of all, Snow White (2025) is not simply bad—it is infuriatingly bad. It is an insult to the intelligence of its audience, an affront to the legacy of the original story, and a grim testament to the cynical, creatively bankrupt state of modern Hollywood. Watching this film was not merely a waste of time; it was an actively harmful experience, an endurance test that left me in a state of existential despair.

In conclusion, Snow White (2025) is a putrid, ill-conceived disasterpiece of epic proportions. It is a film so excruciatingly dreadful that it transcends mere mediocrity and becomes a genuine act of cultural vandalism. If you value your sanity, your dignity, or your precious, irreplaceable time on this Earth, avoid this cinematic abomination at all costs.

This isn't about racial discrimination—it's about staying true to the source material. Traditionally, fantasy books, cartoons, and illustrations have portrayed characters—especially female leads—as white, often with a specific aesthetic. Suddenly changing that to cast actors of different racial backgrounds may be seen as progressive, but it breaks the consistency and visual tone set by the original stories.

Take The Little Mermaid, for example. The animated version depicted Ariel with a very specific look—fair skin, red hair, and delicate features. Casting choices should reflect that design if the goal is to stay loyal to the fantasy world fans grew up with. Kristen Stewart or Amy Adams, for instance, would have been a more visually accurate match for that kind of role. The same issue exists in the recent Snow White adaptation—neither Snow White nor the witch looked like their classic fairy tale counterparts.

It’s not just about race—it’s also about facial and physical features that align with the fantasy aesthetic. Casting should prioritize visual fidelity to the original characters, whether the actors are white, black, or brown. Unfortunately, Hollywood has been missing the mark lately on both fronts.

The casting to try to score virtue points just doesn't work, especially when your main actress is so hostile to people that do not mirror their beliefs that she actually discourages them from watching the movie. Nobody likes or wants to support a loudmouth. 

I love that Gal Gadot was in this, but I just don't think she fit the role. The character had no depth or development, very poorly written and very wooden. I normally love Gal Gadot but this was probably her protest performance by a mile.

I've seen images of Rachel Ziegler and her hair in this movie was awful, there are pics where her hair looked so much better. In the movie it made her look like Jason from South Park. The hair dept really did her dirty because it can look so much better. The story line is awful, I don't know why that had to change, or why an old classic couldn't be left alone. The lighting in the film is very moody. It's become a big thing to have dark and dingy movies and I don't understand it. 

So with an arrogant, mismatched lead, lifeless songs, ugly CGI dwarves that each look like a different rendition of King Charles and lighting that provides a view similar to the vision of someone with macular degeneration, it's a no from me. Stick with the 1937 version.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Main Cast/Stars did well though. They can really show emotional fluctuations when it's necessary for the part. They get 4-stars also.

If you ever wondered what it would look like if a classic fairy tale got run over by a dump truck full of CGI, misplaced feminism, and bizarre casting decisions — voilà, Disney’s Snow White 2025 is here to answer that question. And the answer is: a hot enchanted mess.

Let’s start with Snow White herself, played by Rachel Zegler, who spends most of the movie looking like she’d rather be anywhere else — maybe at home watching the original 1937 movie she publicly shaded (awkward!). She delivers every line like she’s doing a TikTok monologue in between sips of oat milk. Empowerment is great, but watching Snow White go from “fairest of them all” to “grumpiest of them all” was… a choice.

Gal Gadot plays the Evil Queen, and I use the word “evil” loosely — she looks like she’s having a blast pretending to be evil, but ends up channeling more ""Real Housewife having a bad Botox day"" than ""terrifying monarch obsessed with immortality.""

And then... the dwarfs. Oh boy. The CGI dwarfs look like rejected video game NPCs who escaped from a glitchy beta test. One reviewer said they looked like someone “wrapped Disneyland statues in human flesh,” and honestly that’s generous. I spent half the movie wondering if I should laugh, cry, or call an exorcist.

Plot-wise, it’s like someone tried to remix Snow White with a TED Talk and forgot to add actual joy or stakes. There’s not even a real prince anymore — just vibes. Remember when fairy tales were magical? This one feels like it was written by a committee of people who skimmed the Wikipedia summary of the original and decided to “fix it” with zero charm and a PowerPoint full of buzzwords.

The songs? Meh. The pacing? Glacial. The tone? More confused than a huntsman in a vegan butcher shop.

Bottom line: Snow White 2025 is like if your childhood memories got hijacked by a focus group. It’s not a movie. It’s a cautionary tale — and the moral is: not everything needs a gritty reboot, especially when the dwarfs look like cursed Funko Pops.

Save yourself the trouble and rewatch the original. Or better yet, go talk to a mirror. It'll give you better feedback than this film.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

No matter what, they'll come up with some reason to hate, even if (such as in this case) the new movie enhances the story of the older one.

(Warning: potential for minor spoilers)

I will admit, when the trailer came out I was thrown off by the CGI dwarves. But when watching the movie, they weren't nearly as off-putting. In fact, I think the way they did the CGI (both in the choice and the execution) was done well. They didn't look weird and out of place, and the CGI gave them that flexibility with facial features that can't always be pulled off by real faces. (If you want non-cgi dwarves, go watch Mirror Mirror)

As for the changes to Prince Charming/Jonathan... I mean, the prince in the 1937 movie was only in it for what? 2 scenes? His only purpose was to break the sleeping curse. The new movie at least gave him more of a story and a purpose. Actually made him a character in the story rather than just a means to an end.

Also, on the Evil Queen, I think people are just so used to either complex tragic villains, or at least villains with depth. They seem to forget just how shallow the original Disney Evil Queen was. For god's sake she perpetuated a one-sided feud with a teenager. And this Evil Queen isn't a tragic villain either. She's Evil Queen Grimhilde, not Evil Queen Regina. If you want a tragic and complex evil queen watch Once Upon A Time.

Rachel Zegler did an incredible job portraying Snow White. And the character herself was very likeable. She started out as earnest and a bit naive, and then developed into a determined and steadfast leader, all whilst maintaining her heart of compassion. I'm sure there will be complaints about diverging from the ""damsel in distress"" storyline, but is it not more inspirational to have a story of a character who became the hero that she was waiting for?

And Oh my GOD the music was AMAZING. The enduring themes, the reprises, they were all absolutely wonderful. I could listen to ""Good Things Grow"" on repeat and never grow tired of it. And ""Princess Problems"" was both hilarious and poked fun at a lot of enduring disney princess criticisms.

Were there some moments that were ""eh"" in the movie? Of course! But no movie is completely perfect. Most of the issues I had with the plot were sustaining issues from the original that could not be changed without drastically changing the storyline, so I'll accept them (and some of the changes that were made actually fixed a lot of the problems I had with the original film). Do I wish that Snow White's (actual) mom and not just her father got more screentime and/or acknowledgement? Of course! But there is only so much you can fit within a single movie.

Anyways. This was a great movie, and a great remake. It does not deserve the hate being heaped on it, and actually did an incredible job. Go watch it an see for yourselves.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

Here are the major flows: The Wicked Queen’s song and dance number is terrible.  “Someday, My Prince Will Come” is sadly scrapped.  There are unnecessary action scenes, this movie could be about 15 minutes shorter in length.  

The pros still outweigh the cons. “Waiting on a Wish” is a nice little number and Rachel really shows off her singing abilities.  In fact, when considering how much of the film is a blend of humans with CGI, Rachel does a lot of solo acting, and she’s terrific.  Every scene she’s in feels strong. Snow White is an interesting person.  

The best scenes are when they lean into the source material in visually striking ways. Snow White running terrified through the forest being snared by tree branches is thrilling. The transition from dark to light as woodland creatures emerge from the forest is magical. In someways the entire movie feels like an amusement park ride at the Magic Kingdom, which is completely fine.  Which brings me back to my point, it could have been a little more simplified, and like the wait for a ride at Disney World, the run time could be shorter.","You and 13 other people found this helpful.","13 people found this helpful."

Yes.  To quote a prior review, this movie is ""magical.""  Funny thing about magic.  It comes in two varieties in the worlds crafted and retold by the Grimm Brothers:  White and Black.  These scholars were attempting to preserve Germanic folklore by collecting and recording folktales and fairy tales from different regions of Germany, and in doing so helping to preserve the rich cultural heritage of the country.  This movie is a dark and hideous abomination that attempts to twist those laudable goals into a pettishly corrupt and twisted tale that is singularly designed for the indoctrination of innocent children into a Woke culture.   If that kind of filth is your thing, then its for you.  But please leave your kids at home.  Unless, of course, you hate them.

This movie is a soulless, joyless, and utterly misguided adaptation that proves even the most magical stories can be drained of their charm when corporate meddling and a lack of creative vision take center stage.

First, let’s talk about Snow White herself. The titular character, once known for her kindness and innocence, has been transformed into a bland, uninspired protagonist with all the depth of a puddle. Her character arc feels forced, her motivations are muddled, and there’s barely any reason to root for her. The performance is as wooden as the lifeless CGI forest she wanders through, making it hard to believe she’s the same enchanting princess generations have adored.

And speaking of the visuals—what happened here? Disney has more money than most small countries, yet the CGI in this movie looks like it was cobbled together by an intern during their lunch break. The seven dwarfs, or rather, the bizarre creatures that have replaced them, look like they belong in a cheap mobile game. It’s as if the filmmakers were actively trying to erase the magic that made the original so special.

Then there’s the script, which manages to be both painfully dull and unintentionally hilarious. The dialogue feels like it was ripped from a poorly written Twitter thread, full of clunky modernisms that clash horribly with the fairy-tale setting. At times, it seems like the movie is embarrassed to even be a fantasy film, constantly undercutting its own sincerity with awkward, out-of-place humor.

The villain? Forgettable. The romance? Nonexistent. The songs? Lifeless imitations of better classics. Every ounce of wonder and whimsy that made Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a cinematic landmark has been stripped away, leaving behind a film that feels more like a corporate checklist than a heartfelt retelling.

Disney had one job: honor a beloved classic while bringing something fresh to the table. Instead, they delivered a creatively bankrupt mess that no one asked for. If you love Snow White, do yourself a favor—stay far, far away from this disaster.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Disney has such a loyal fan base and an amazing creative team, stop rehashing old films and ideas and shoehorning different narratives into them - come up with something new, new ideas, new stories, new princes and princes. Disney’s cannon is evidently more fragile than, for example, Shakespeare body of work; it can’t be interpreted in each and any way, these originals clearly meant something, this movie erased that and I understand why audiences are very unhappy about it.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

I get it, you want to modernize the story, but this isn’t exactly the Snow White we grew up with. She's more focused on speeches about empowerment than, you know, being a princess.

And then there are the dwarfs. Instead of the lovable characters we know, they’ve been turned into a forgettable bunch of “diverse” stereotypes with none of the charm or humor that made them so endearing. It’s like they tried to be progressive but ended up just stripping the characters of what made them fun. As for the Evil Queen—remember the fabulously vain, malicious villain of the original? Now she’s just a woman with some self-esteem issues. Not nearly as terrifying.

Let’s talk visuals—everything looks like it was made in a computer lab. The overdone CGI animals, fake forests, and glitzy castles make the film feel more like a video game than a fairy tale. Honestly, it’s all style with no substance, trying way too hard to be ""magical"" while losing all the warmth and heart that made the original so enchanting.

In short, the new Snow White is a sad reminder of how Disney seems to have forgotten the formula that made their classics so enduring. It’s as though someone watched the original, decided it needed a ""makeover,"" and then proceeded to turn it into a messy, poorly executed attempt at social commentary, wrapped in glitter and fake magic. If you were hoping for a nostalgic return to the fairy tale you grew up with, do yourself a favor and stick to the original.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White, while vocally competent, lacks the depth and charm necessary to carry the film. Her performance is overshadowed by a script that attempts to modernize the character but instead renders her insipid and unrelatable. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, though visually striking, is a caricature devoid of menace, reducing one of Disney's most iconic villains to a mere shadow of her former self. (San Francisco Chronicle)

The film's visual effects are another significant drawback. The CGI-rendered dwarfs are unconvincing and unsettling, failing to evoke the warmth and camaraderie that made the original ensemble so endearing. This reliance on subpar digital effects detracts from the film's overall aesthetic and further alienates the audience.
(Financial Times)


Musically, the addition of new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul falls flat. The compositions are forgettable and fail to capture the timeless quality of the original score, leaving audiences yearning for the classic melodies that defined the 1937 masterpiece. (New York Post, The Atlantic)

Critics have been overwhelmingly negative in their assessments. The Guardian lambasted the film as ""toe-curlingly terrible,"" highlighting the uninspired performances and lackluster execution. Similarly, the New York Post described it as ""one more boring, mediocre live-action Disney retread,"" emphasizing the film's failure to justify its existence.
(thetimes.co.uk, theguardian.com, New York Post)

Box office performance mirrors these critical pummelings. Opening with a meager $43 million domestically, the film's financial returns are as underwhelming as its creative endeavors. (The Atlantic, Los Angeles Times)
 

In an era where audiences crave originality and authenticity, Disney's ""Snow White"" serves as a cautionary tale against the perils of unnecessary remakes. It stands as a stark reminder that some stories are best left untouched, preserving the magic that made them classics in the first place.

You’ve got a $270 million dumpster fire that makes Mulan 2020 look like a masterpiece.

another issue is a long standing one where disney has for decades now refused to pay writers and animators to come up with any new original stories or characters while other studios filled this gap in the market and have made way more iconic films that have defined the media landscape of many people's childhoods: toy story, finding nemo, monsters inc, etc. indeed the more iconic disney princesses and stories and characters were already just animated retellings of fairytales and stories that already existed.  people want another lelo and stitch -- no, not a 'remake' of lelo and stitch -- they want an original animated film or story that is memorable like that film. but unfortunately disney is run by a bunch of incompetent people propped up by everyone else.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

You can feel Disney’s desperation radiating from the screen like the smell of burnt popcorn at a gas station movie theater. They don’t care about storytelling, legacy, or art anymore. They just want to milk nostalgia dry, like a vampire who only feeds on childhood memories.

Where do I even begin? This ""reimagining"" of Snow White isn't just bad, it's offensively dull. It seems Disney has forgotten what made the original animated classic magical in the first place. They've stripped away the charm, the heart, and the timeless fairy tale quality, replacing it with awkward attempts at modernization that fall completely flat.

The story changes feel forced and preachy, sacrificing genuine character development and wonder for clumsy messaging. Snow White herself is rendered almost unrecognizable – gone is the gentle innocence, replaced by a bland, vaguely defiant archetype that generates zero audience connection. The supporting characters, including the bizarrely handled companions (let's not even get into that change), lack any memorable personality or warmth.

Visually, the film is surprisingly drab and uninspired. Instead of a vibrant fairy tale world, we get generic CGI landscapes and a color palette that seems allergic to joy. The magic is gone, replaced by a cynical, corporate sheen. The performances feel phoned-in, lacking conviction or chemistry. Even the iconic villain feels neutered, more petulant than truly menacing.

This entire production feels utterly pointless. It doesn't enhance the original, it doesn't offer a compelling new take, it just... exists. It's a hollow, joyless exercise seemingly created by committee, ticking boxes nobody asked for. Save your time and money. Re-watch the animated masterpiece instead. This version is a profound disappointment and a stain on the legacy of a beloved story. One star is frankly generous.","You and 7 other people found this helpful.","7 people found this helpful."

The movie is dull and lifeless.  Snow White has a homely uninspiring demeanor throughout.  The CGI dwarfs are just a step above the proposal of seven magical creatures that had been mused.  The only brightside is the portrayal of the evil queen stepmother played by Gal Gadot.  Although, her performance is tainted by poor writing of the scriptwriter.  Having her sing negates the evil persona the queen should display.  But Gadot does pull out what she can from a bad script.

I have been an annual passholder for many years.  I appreciate Walt Disneys policy that the character actors in the parks be of an appropriate size and appearance to match the characters in the films.  It helps to promote the Disney magic.  Disney is going in the wrong direction with the last two remakes of Tge Little Mermaid and Snow White.  Yes, there can be a black mermaid but Ariel can not be black.  Yes, there can be an olive skinned princess but Snow White can not have olive skin.  Please make a movie about a black mermaid or Latina princess.  I will watch them and love them.  Walt Disney wanted the appearance to match.  If you decide to make a live action princess and the frog, please do not cast Taylor Swift or Miley Cyrus as Tiana because they just do not have the appropriate appearance.

Just watched Snow White, and honestly? It’s a lot better than people are making it out to be. Rachel Zegler’s performance was great, and Gal Gadot did a solid job too. Sure, there were changes—but let’s be real, every Disney live-action remake has had tweaks (Aladdin included).

The movie is nostalgic, musically brilliant, and visually stunning. If you’ve ever been to Disneyland, it really gives off that same magical feeling. So if you’re on the fence, maybe just watch it and decide for yourself instead of letting the internet hate train make up your mind.

At the end of the day, movies are meant to be enjoyed, not torn apart before they’re even seen. So why not give it a shot? Worst case, you don’t love it. Best case, you walk away pleasantly surprised.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

The film, meant to be a live-action adaptation of the 1937 masterpiece, makes sweeping changes that ultimately undermine what made the original so beloved.

From the outset, the decision to remove key elements—such as the iconic dwarfs in favor of a diverse group of “magical companions”—feels arbitrary and forced. Instead of enhancing the narrative, these alterations strip the film of its charm and fairytale essence. Likewise, the reworked Snow White, portrayed with a more independent and assertive personality, is so far removed from her original character that she feels like an entirely different protagonist. While strong female leads are nothing new, her arc lacks the warmth and sincerity that made her initial journey compelling.

The film’s greatest failing, however, is its prioritization of social messaging over coherent storytelling. Themes of empowerment are not organically woven into the plot but rather imposed at the expense of character depth and emotional investment. The Prince’s role is virtually erased, the romance subplot is discarded, and what remains is a film that feels less like a timeless fantasy and more like a checklist of modern sensibilities.

Visually, Snow White (2025) is competent but uninspired, lacking the whimsical artistry that defined its animated predecessor. The script is equally lackluster, filled with stilted dialogue that struggles to balance its contemporary agenda with the timelessness of a fairytale. The result is a film that alienates both longtime fans and new audiences alike—too self-serious to be magical, yet too shallow to be profound.

Disney had an opportunity to pay homage to a cinematic treasure while subtly modernizing elements where necessary. Instead, Snow White (2025) opts for revisionism over reverence, leaving behind a hollow adaptation that ultimately fails to capture the heart of the story it sought to retell.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

As a result the movie felt very kid friendly… like a toddler could watch it. I liked the dwarfs though their loyalty was less understandable due to the duration of their friendship in this version. Overall, good movie and I would definitely recommend watching it especially if you have very young children.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

	•	Plot overhaul: The new film reportedly shifts away from the original 1937 storyline. For example, there’s speculation that Prince Charming may not be included at all, and Snow White doesn’t seem to be “saved” by a kiss.
	•	“Modernization” backlash: Critics say the film is being “modernized” to the point that it loses the essence of the original fairy tale. Rachel Zegler (who plays Snow White) has made statements suggesting the new Snow White is “not going to be saved by a man,” which some fans think undermines the original’s fairytale charm.

2. Casting and Character Choices
	•	Rachel Zegler as Snow White: Some viewers have criticized Disney for casting someone who doesn’t resemble the original character’s description (“skin as white as snow”). While others argue it’s a good step toward diversity, some traditionalists feel it strays too far from the original intent.
	•	Dwarfs replaced: The original seven dwarfs are reportedly being replaced by a group of diverse magical creatures or characters, leading to criticism that Disney is erasing iconic characters rather than respectfully modernizing them. Even actor Peter Dinklage criticized the portrayal of dwarfs in fairy tales but wasn’t happy with how Disney responded.

3. Public Statements and Marketing
	•	Controversial interviews: Rachel Zegler has made comments in interviews that some fans found dismissive of the original movie. For example, she called Prince Charming a “stalker” and said she “hated” the original as a kid. This rubbed many fans the wrong way.
	•	Tone-deaf promotion: The marketing so far (what little has been released) hasn’t reassured fans—it’s come off as a bit arrogant and out of touch, focusing more on “fixing” the story rather than celebrating it.

4. Visuals and Leaks
	•	Leaked set photos: Some leaked images showed what appears to be a very low-budget set with cardboard-looking trees and costumes that don’t reflect Disney’s usual high production value. Fans compared it to cosplay or fan-made films.
	•	Delayed release: The movie has been pushed back (now set for 2025), adding to speculation that it’s facing production issues or Disney is trying to rework parts of it due to backlash.

5. General “Woke” Accusations
	•	A lot of the backlash is centered around the idea that Disney is pushing an agenda rather than telling a good story. While some viewers support the changes, others feel like Disney is trying too hard to make a political or social statement, losing the magic and timelessness of the fairy tale in the process.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The message of the movie really hit me: being kind, sharing, and caring for others-no matter what. Not evil. Not petty. Just pure-hearted. And that's what Snow White has always been about.

Yes, this idea couldn't get more lame. So instead of nothing to hire 7 actors with dwarfism, they wanted taller people. Then they decided to use little. Except the little people were crappy CGI. 

There are actors with dwarfism that have literally been ignored by these movie companies. They literally discriminate people with dwarfism unless they have high profile like Peter Dinklage who seems to only want to be the only actor with dwarfism in Hollywood. 

Most of cinemas during opening was completely empty. Absolute embarrassment for Disney. They still insisted it would do well as box office. I didn't read much rubbish since the little mermaid failure. 

They pushed and pushed their agenda to try and educate than entertain, especially to get right. But they failed miserably.

Now they are out of pocket on their stupid gamble and paying for it as they Disney stocks plummeted.

Disney used to create timeless films that resonated with audiences because they focused on great storytelling, memorable characters, and universal themes. Movies like the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were beloved not because they followed a corporate-driven message but because they captured imagination, heart, and magic in a way that stood the test of time.

Lately, Disney has abandoned that approach, prioritizing agenda-driven storytelling over what made these classics great. Instead of respecting the original source material and the legacy that built Disney into what it is today, they keep changing stories to fit modern narratives that not everyone asked for or agrees with. The charm, innocence, and wonder that once defined Disney films are being sacrificed for messaging, and it’s becoming more obvious with every new release.

Audiences want great movies, not lectures. If Disney wants to regain the trust of lifelong fans, they need to stop rewriting history to fit their current ideology and instead focus on what made their classics timeless in the first place—great storytelling, strong characters, and the kind of magic that speaks to everyone, not just a select group.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

The film tries desperately to convince the audience that it’s a fresh and empowering take, yet it stumbles over its own self-importance, forgetting to actually tell a compelling story in the process. The CGI creatures feel ripped from a discount fantasy flick, the set design lacks any real magic or whimsy, and the pacing is so sluggish that even the most patient viewers might find themselves glancing at their watches. And then there's Rachel Zegler’s Snow White—an uninspired, charisma-deprived interpretation of the beloved character that somehow manages to drain all the warmth and charm from the role. Her delivery is flat, her presence lacks the fairy-tale enchantment needed to carry the film, and at times, she appears as though she’d rather be anywhere else. Despite the movie’s relentless attempts to be a “bold reimagining,” it ends up feeling soulless and detached, like a studio-mandated checklist of buzzwords rather than a genuine adaptation. At the end of the day, for all the controversy, reworks, and PR gymnastics, the film doesn’t even have the decency to be bad in an entertaining way—it’s just painfully, aggressively mid.","You and 16 other people found this helpful.","16 people found this helpful."

Rachel Zegler, the new face of Snow White, delivers her performance with all the warmth and charm of a LinkedIn influencer. Instead of bringing grace or wonder to the role, she treats it like a punishment—rolling her eyes through scenes like she’s above it all. Her public comments bashing the original film bleed into the performance: she seems genuinely annoyed to be playing a character who once believed in love or magic. If you’re wondering what happens when an actor openly despises the source material—this is it.

Disney’s attempt to modernize the story strips it of any whimsy, replacing dwarves with whatever unrecognizable substitutes they thought might avoid controversy, and turning the tale of growth and kindness into an awkward, preachy empowerment manifesto. It’s not empowering—it’s condescending.

Instead of honoring what came before, the film tears it down, pats itself on the back, and expects applause. But all that’s left is a hollow shell of a classic, fronted by a lead who clearly wishes she were anywhere else.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The graphics and sets were fantastic with such detail and colour.  I also loved the dwarfs, especially Dopey who has such a wonderful realism.

The biggest let down was the music.  They tried for the big numbers like in Moana but missed.  They tried for the family friendly numbers and ended up sounding more like High Five.  The only song stuck in my head is HiHo which is from the original movie though its was extended very well.

From the moment the film began, it was clear that all the magic, charm, and heart of the original had been completely sucked out, replaced by a lifeless, glossy mess of bad CGI and uninspired performances.

Let’s start with the CGI. It’s astounding how a big-budget production could produce visuals that look so cheap and artificial. The forest scenes were supposed to feel enchanting and alive but instead came off as painfully fake, with plastic-looking trees and weirdly animated creatures that seemed ripped straight out of a second-rate video game. The “magic” that once felt genuine and captivating was drowned out by an overabundance of soulless computer-generated nonsense.

Now, the acting. Oh boy, where do I even begin? The performances were wooden and devoid of any real emotion. The actress playing Snow White delivered her lines with all the enthusiasm of someone reading a grocery list. She seemed more like a mannequin reciting dialogue than a real character experiencing the wonder and terror of her journey. The supporting cast wasn’t much better, with everyone appearing bored, stiff, and utterly disconnected from the material.

The writing didn’t do the actors any favors, either. The dialogue felt clunky and lifeless, devoid of any of the whimsy or heart that made the original story so memorable. Every line was delivered with a flatness that made me question if the cast even wanted to be there. And when the film attempted humor or emotional moments, it only made the failure more glaring.

Ultimately, Snow White (2025) feels like a cynical, half-baked attempt to cash in on nostalgia without even a shred of respect for what made the original so timeless. The film is a hollow shell of its predecessor, bogged down by dreadful CGI, embarrassingly stiff acting, and a complete disregard for the magic and warmth of the classic tale.

It takes so many liberties with the classic story that it barely resembles the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Snow White, once known for her kindness and innocence, is now portrayed as a bold leader, which completely changes the heart of her character. The most baffling decision, though, is removing the seven dwarfs and replacing them with a group of human-like companions. The dwarfs weren’t just comic relief—they were Snow White’s family, offering protection and emotional depth, and without them, the story loses one of its most iconic elements. The Evil Queen, once a terrifying symbol of vanity and jealousy, is reportedly softened into a more sympathetic character, which takes away her impact as a true villain. Prince Charming has also been heavily minimized, removing the fairy tale romance that was central to the original. While reimagining a classic can sometimes work, this version changes so much that it feels like a completely different story rather than an updated take on a beloved film. If this were just another fantasy movie, it might stand on its own, but as a remake of Snow White, it completely misses the mark. Fans who grew up with the original will likely be disappointed by how little remains of the story they loved.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

This film is a soulless, uninspired attempt to cash in on nostalgia, resulting in a muddled mess that disrespects its source material and insults the intelligence of its audience.

From the outset, the film's misguided attempts at modernization are painfully evident. The decision to axe the traditional prince character in favor of a bland, Robin Hood-esque figure named Jonathan is baffling and unnecessary. This change adds nothing of value and instead detracts from the original narrative's charm. Even more egregious is the treatment of the seven dwarfs, now rendered as mo-cap animated figures that lack any semblance of personality or authenticity. This pseudo-progressive approach is both exhausting and patronizing, leaving viewers yearning for the simplicity and sincerity of the original characters.

The performances are equally abysmal. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White is insipid and forgettable, failing to capture the innocence and grace that made the character beloved. Gal Gadot's turn as the Evil Queen is even more disastrous; her attempts at menace come off as laughable, and her performance lacks the depth and nuance required for such an iconic villain. Critics have rightly pointed out that Gadot's portrayal is possibly her worst to date, devoid of the glamor and fierceness that the role demands.

Visually, the film is an assault on the senses. The CGI is overused and poorly executed, making the enchanted forest look more like a cheap video game backdrop than a magical realm. The decision to ""cartoonize"" the dwarfs alongside human actors is jarring and further alienates the audience from any emotional connection to the characters.

The musical numbers, typically a highlight in Disney films, are forgettable and uninspired. The new songs fail to capture the magic of the original score, and their placement within the film feels forced and awkward. The choreography is lackluster, and the performances lack the energy and enthusiasm that one would expect from a Disney musical.

In conclusion, Disney's ""Snow White"" is a travesty that should serve as a cautionary tale for filmmakers. It is a prime example of how not to approach a remake, stripping away the heart and soul of the original in favor of misguided attempts at modernization and inclusivity. This film is not only a disservice to the legacy of Disney but also to audiences who deserve far better. Avoid this cinematic abomination at all costs.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Let’s not sugarcoat this: Snow White (2025) is an unmitigated trainwreck of a film that stumbles through its runtime with all the grace of a drunk dwarf in a wind tunnel. Disney’s latest attempt to “modernise” a classic feels less like a tribute and more like a half-hearted cash grab stitched together with leftover CGI and TikTok-level dialogue.

The lead performance is wooden at best, painfully smug at worst. The iconic innocence and charm of the original Snow White has been replaced with a snarky, one-dimensional caricature who spends more time giving condescending monologues than doing anything remotely endearing. If charisma was a requirement for royalty, this Snow White would be banished before the opening credits finished.

The dwarfs—or whatever the film is awkwardly calling them now—are stripped of any personality. They aren’t funny. They aren’t memorable. They're just there. Like set dressing with speaking roles. The chemistry between the characters is nonexistent, and the entire ensemble feels like it was assembled in a corporate boardroom by people who’ve never seen a movie, let alone made a good one.

The visuals are gaudy and artificial, drenched in soulless CGI that looks like it was rendered on a 2012 laptop. The enchanted forest looks about as magical as a carpark on a rainy Tuesday, and the costumes seem like they were borrowed from a rejected Once Upon a Time spin-off.

As for the script—dear god. It’s a mess of forced “girlboss” platitudes, awkward humour, and lines that feel like they were written by a committee of marketers trying to go viral. There's no heart, no wonder, no narrative soul. Just empty gestures and preachy posturing.

In short: Snow White (2025) is not a reimagining. It’s a botched plastic surgery of a beloved fairy tale, stripped of its spirit and bloated with ego. The fairest of them all? Please. This one doesn’t even deserve a cracked mirror.

The thought of seeing such a classic fairytale brought to life  with real forests, castles, and all the enchanting visuals was something I genuinely looked forward to. And a big part of that excitement came from imagining what the actress would look like, especially because the original story is so specific in its description.

In the original tale, Snow White is described as having “skin as white as snow” not as a beauty standard, but as a literal part of her character’s name and identity. The story is rooted in a European setting, and everything from the styling to the cultural backdrop reflects that. So changing something that’s been so visually iconic for decades doesn’t feel like a modern upgrade it feels like erasing part of what made the story so distinct.

And I say this as a Latina woman who deeply values representation. I love seeing diversity on screen I think it’s powerful and overdue in many places. But what I don’t love is when studios take characters that are already culturally and visually established, and change them to check a box, instead of creating something new and authentic. We don’t need to rewrite Snow White to feel seen we need our own stories, our own fairytales, our own leads.

The actress they chose for this version is clearly talented and has a stunning voice. But that only made me wish they had cast her as a brand-new character maybe a South American princess, or someone in a fresh story that better reflects her background. That would be real inclusion not this kind of awkward rewrite that leaves the original fans alienated and underrepresents the actress’s own cultural potential.

It’s frustrating because fair skin is no longer even the “beauty standard” in popular culture everyone wants to look tan now. Fake tan, sunbeds, bronzer  it’s everywhere. It’s no longer about “white skin” being the ideal. So when we finally have a story that centers a fair-skinned girl someone who was described specifically for her fair skin it gets changed. And for what? It doesn’t feel like inclusion; it feels like dilution.

What’s even more frustrating is that they had a real opportunity to showcase actual diversity like casting real actors with dwarfism as the seven dwarfs. Instead, they CGI’d them. They used fake, cartoonish visuals instead of hiring people from a community that rarely gets representation. It’s such a contradiction: they claim to care about inclusion, but when it really matters, they don’t follow through. Why have a chance to celebrate the representation of minorities in one place, but not take the step to actually cast and represent them authentically where it matters most? That’s where the true missed opportunity lies.

This remake feels confused. It’s trying to send a progressive message by altering the main character in a way that upsets the original audience, while missing out on the real chances to include underrepresented communities authentically. Why not make a new story with characters of different backgrounds from the start? Why force a square peg into a round hole?

It’s not about race. It’s about respecting stories and creating new ones that uplift everyone, without erasing the ones that came before.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

I grew up loving Disney. The classics were full of magic, heart, and characters that felt timeless. But with each new live-action remake, it feels like Disney is moving further away from what made these stories special. Snow White (2025) is yet another example of this trend, and at this point, I’ve had enough.

Casting is a crucial part of bringing these beloved characters to life, yet Disney continuously ignores what makes them iconic. Snow White is meant to be ""the fairest of them all,"" but the casting choice here simply doesn’t reflect that. The same issue happened with Beauty and the Beast—Belle is supposed to be breathtakingly beautiful, yet the actress chosen didn’t capture that essence. And after The Little Mermaid changed Ariel’s entire look, it’s clear that Disney is no longer interested in staying true to these fairy tales.

It’s not just about appearances—it’s about honoring the original stories instead of rewriting them beyond recognition. Every remake feels like an agenda-driven project rather than a heartfelt tribute to the classics. The magic, the wonder, and the nostalgia I once felt for Disney have been completely lost.

I used to adore Disney, but with each passing remake, it becomes harder to watch. My love for these movies died years ago, and with Snow White (2025), it feels like there's nothing left of the Disney I once cherished.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

What was once a timeless fairytale full of charm, innocence, and magic has been transformed into a hollow, soulless shell of itself—stripped of heart, purpose, and even basic storytelling coherence. If you were hoping for a nostalgic reimagining of the 1937 masterpiece, prepare for a jarring experience. This film is anything but a tribute to the classic.

Let’s begin with the acting. To put it plainly: it’s awkward, wooden, and emotionally disconnected. The lead performance lacks the depth, warmth, and vulnerability that made the original Snow White such a beloved character. Instead of portraying her as a kind-hearted and hopeful figure, the new Snow White comes across as emotionally flat, with a performance that feels more like someone reading lines in a rehearsal than embodying a princess in a magical kingdom. The supporting cast fares no better, with performances that feel phoned-in or painfully overacted. It’s as if the cast themselves weren’t sure what kind of movie they were in—fairytale? Satire? Social commentary? It’s never clear.

But where this film truly crashes and burns is in its handling—or rather, mishandling—of the original story. Disney didn’t just update a few themes or modernize the setting. They completely gutted the narrative and replaced it with something unrecognizable. Gone are the iconic elements that made the original tale resonate for generations: the warmth of the forest animals, the genuine friendship between Snow White and the dwarfs, and the powerful message of kindness triumphing over cruelty. Instead, we’re given a preachy, disjointed script with little character development and forced dialogue that feels like it was written by a committee more concerned with making statements than telling a story..

Visually, the film is dull. Gone are the breathtaking hand-drawn animations and lush fairy-tale landscapes. In their place are bland CGI backdrops and uninspired costume design. Despite the massive budget, the movie somehow feels cheap—overproduced and under-thought.

The saddest part is that Disney had all the tools to create something magical. The original Snow White wasn’t just about a girl and an apple; it was a story about love, friendship, jealousy, and hope. It taught us that kindness matters, and that true beauty lies within. This new version teaches us… well, I’m not entirely sure what it’s trying to teach. The story is so muddled with revisions and awkward subtext that it ultimately says nothing meaningful at all.

In trying to make Snow White more “modern” and “empowered,” Disney forgot what made her powerful in the first place: her unwavering kindness, her ability to inspire loyalty and love, and her gentle spirit in the face of cruelty. The result is a film that alienates long-time fans, confuses younger viewers, and erases the emotional legacy of the original.

All.In.One.Day.

In between those events (and more), she (Rachel Zegler) and the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot) managed to create the most uncomfortable movements ever seen on screen. Unfortunately, Gal Gadot does sing in this movie—about what? I don’t know, because she kept flickering her fingers and smoldering into the camera (and because the songs were so forgettable).

There’s a scene in the movie where Snow White hands the crook (not the prince, because he was weird, weird, weird) —who’s dressed like Jonathan Bailey from Wicked (and yes, his name is actually Jonathan in the movie)—a piece of bread. When he accidentally brushes her hand, Snow White gasps like she doesn’t understand human interaction.

The amount of smirks in this movie, the out-of-place slow motion of Snow White dancing, and the random necklace on her that had no meaning to the story—it was all just… a lot.

There are a million things I could say about this movie, but none would top how much CGI is shoved into it. The deer, the dwarves, and the forest were completely unrecognizable. The deer had big, bulging AI-generated eyes, and when Snow White fell into the lake, she pulled herself out and handed them a dry piece of bread. I had to watch an AI-generated deer eat a dry piece of bread from someone who just fell from the sky into a lake.

Now the dwarves—what a monstrosity. Completely CGI, resembling the original characters’ faces but now just completely dead inside.

But let me not focus only on the negatives. There are a few positives! They didn’t change the dwarves’ song, and there are many references to other Disney films. And by “references,” I mean entire storylines from other Disney princesses stuffed into one. She has one song where she sings like Mulan, looking into a well asking herself who she’s supposed to be. One part feels like Tangled—she’s with Jonathan, there are lanterns (well, fireflies) all around, and they sing about finally feeling a connection and a change. Then there’s a live-action Aladdin-style scene where she starts calling out things she remembers about the townspeople. Right after that, there’s a Radio Rebel moment where the townspeople all start saying, “I remember. I remember how it used to be when the king was here.”

Instead of spending money on this, rewatch the original Snow White, or just watch snippets of Cinderella, Tangled, Aladdin, and Robin Hood to get the full effect.","You and 110 other people found this helpful.","110 people found this helpful."

From the outset, the film seems more focused on ticking boxes than on storytelling. The characters are hollowed out versions of their former selves, stripped of charm and depth in favor of preachy dialogue that feels forced and contrived. Snow White herself, rather than embodying resilience and kindness, comes off as a caricature of modern ideals, lacking the warmth and spirit that made the original iconic.

The pacing is excruciatingly slow, with long-winded monologues that feel more like lectures than engaging narrative. The once-enchanting forest is now a backdrop for clumsy social commentary, overshadowing any sense of magic or wonder. The dwarfs have a ‘Polar Express’ CGI characteristic and no real personalities. It was boat casting of relegated to mere symbols of diversity, lose their individual personalities, leaving audiences with a group of interchangeable characters that are more politically “correct” than relatable.

Musically, the film falls flat. The new songs, while attempting to be catchy, are forgettable, lack the emotional resonance of the original, and nonsense lyrically. Instead of memorable melodies, we’re treated to a series of tuneless numbers that feel forced into the narrative.

Visually, the film boasts impressive production design, but even the stunning visuals can’t salvage the disjointed script and lackluster performances. It’s a classic case of style over substance, leaving audiences feeling empty rather than uplifted.

In a world craving genuine storytelling, this “woke” rendition of Snow White is a disheartening reminder that not all reboots are created equal. It’s a missed opportunity to honor a beloved tale, instead opting for a muddled agenda that alienates rather than connects.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

Snow White gets her name because she was born in a blizzard...  No joke.  She lives in this socialist/communist utopia where everyone shares the bounty of the land and it all comes to ruin because a greedy queen seizes the power and bounty for herself.

It's only gets worse as after Snow White flees, she runs into the 7 CGI Abominations that make the Ghosts in Pacman look realistic.  She spends some time with them before leaving to meet our leading man who is only there to make her look good and give her a smooch when she eats the poison apple.  Honestly, her eating the apple and fading to black would have been a better ending than what we got.

Instead, our conflict is resolved because...Snow White remembers people.  I'm not joking. After refusing to kill the evil queen herself, the queen's guards are just about to run through Snow White when she suddenly starts remembering their names and what they did in the kingdom.  This somehow touches them?  And they won't follow through.  The queen attempts to kill Snow White instead, but ends up turning into ash/dust for some weird reason...  And then they live happily ever after...

This movie is a joke...  It takes whatever was good about the original and spits on it.  The costumes were cheap, the CGI was awful, the plot seemed to be all over the place with no clear direction, and I wanted to just leave after 30 minutes in.  If you want to watch Snow White, watch any other version of this movie.  Or heck, just go watch a blizzard on youtube!  You'll get more enjoyment out of that compared to two hours of this...  Utter, complete garbage.  And yes, I will now go apologize to my garbage for comparing it to this film.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

Her performance as the Evil Queen felt cheesy and hollow, like she was cosplaying the role instead of inhabiting it. I’m glad she had fun, truly—but fun doesn’t equal quality, and this role demanded more than what she delivered.

Rachel Zegler, on the other hand, was easily the best part of the movie. She brought grace, talent, and presence to the role of Snow White. Unfortunately, the songs she was given didn’t showcase the full range of her powerhouse voice or acting ability. It felt like Disney clipped her wings with bland, uninspired musical numbers. The film failed her, not the other way around.

Now, let’s talk about the dwarves—because what were they thinking? They cast only one actor with dwarfism (for grumpy) and still used CGI versions for all 7 of the dwarves that looked ridiculous and cartoonish. This is supposed to be a live-action adaptation, not a half-baked animation hybrid. I truly wish they would have taken the dwarven characters more seriously and did a full list of actors with dwarfism for all 7. Then, if they were to use CGI do minimal work on them and keep them as realistic as possible. Just saying, Peter Dinklage would have been AMAZING as Any of the dwarves and would have brought so much depth to any character he played (as he always does.) We’ve seen how good CGI can look—How to Train Your Dragon gave us dragons that felt real enough to touch. Disney, with all its resources, chose instead to lean into caricature and stereotype. It’s not just tone-deaf—it’s lazy.

At the end of the day, this remake feels like a cash grab rather than a genuine attempt to reimagine a beloved classic. There was so much potential to do better: better casting, better writing, better representation, better everything. But they didn’t try. And honestly? If they weren’t going to take the story seriously, they shouldn’t have bothered remaking it at all.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

The dwarfs? Wait… sorry, the magical woodland associates (or whatever they’re called now). Half of them look like they just wandered off a Renaissance fair, and the other half seem confused about why they’re in this movie at all.

The CGI? I’ve seen more convincing special effects in a Snapchat filter. The apple scene, a crucial moment of suspense and magic, had all the tension of a grocery store checkout line.

And don’t get me started on the “modernized” dialogue. Imagine if Shakespeare wrote his plays while scrolling through TikTok, that’s the level of painful cringe we’re dealing with here.

The only thing that kept me awake was the sheer absurdity of it all. If you enjoy watching childhood classics get mercilessly rebranded into lifeless, agenda driven cash grabs, then congratulations… this movie was made just for you.

The music was enchanting and brought you in . As much as my stubbornness and ego wanted me to make them turn it off, I was left wanting to see more. 

I sat down with my girls eating popcorn and actually enjoyed the movie. 

It's truly a shame that the actor brought such a personal opinionated agenda that it made most of everyone that's tired of being so PC in a world that's been made so soft that nobody would watch it.  

The dwarves didn't bother me, I actually thought they were a nice touch to bring the cartoon aspect to the movie. I didn't see them as non-binary, I could tell they were manly. The voices were cute and on point in my opinion. I think Grumpy and Dopey were my favorite. 

Acting was good with silly Disney movie undertones. 

Songs were pleasing and had my 3 year old dancing around smiling and laughing. Can't get mad at that. 

The changes they made weren't insulating and I think wouldn't be such a big deal if we weren't already all on eggshells and tired of having to not insult anyone.  

I would suggest watching it and check your political policing at the door and enjoy the movie. 

Well that's my 2 cents.  At the end of the movie I was still a 46 year old straight woman who didn't hate men and liked being a stay at home mom.

From the moment Disney announced the project, it became clear that this was yet another soulless attempt to modernize a beloved classic while stripping away everything that made it special.  

First, let's talk about the complete disregard for the original story. The charm of *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* lay in its fairy-tale magic, innocence, and the beautifully crafted animation that captivated audiences for generations. Now, instead of respecting that legacy, the remake seems determined to turn it into yet another generic, preachy, and overly political spectacle. The filmmakers have gone out of their way to distance themselves from the original themes, as if they’re ashamed of the story that made the movie famous in the first place.  

Then there’s the casting and characterization. The lead actress has made multiple dismissive comments about the original film, implying that the classic love story is outdated and irrelevant. If she has such disdain for the source material, why even take on the role? Audiences don’t want to see a character completely changed to fit modern narratives—they want to see Snow White as the kind-hearted, gentle heroine she was meant to be, not a forced “girlboss” stereotype that Hollywood keeps recycling.  

And don’t even get started on the dwarfs—or lack thereof. Disney’s decision to remove them in favor of CGI ""magical creatures"" is a slap in the face to both fans and actors who could have played the roles. It’s yet another example of the studio caring more about virtue signaling than respecting storytelling or talent.  

At the end of the day, this remake is just another cash grab, devoid of the heart and magic that made the original a timeless classic. It’s a cynical, uninspired mess that no one asked for and, frankly, no one should waste their time watching. If Disney refuses to respect its own legacy, why should audiences support it? Instead of giving attention (and money) to this disaster, it’s better to revisit the 1937 masterpiece and appreciate the artistry and sincerity that made it legendary.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Rachel zegler is disliked. She’s abrasive; because she’s opinionated and not afraid to speak out.  
Shes outspoken, unafraid to be disliked and well.. that’s why so many hate the movie. 

Facts. 

• The movie is not that far off the original 1937 storyline- everyone is up in arms about the changes.. it’s different but still holds intensity and respect for the original 

• She’s talented, she’s a great singer and performer. Just a quick read of her history and you’ll see .. she didn’t just drop into this role. She’s got a history of roles in Disney characters and earned her place. Good for you Rachel. 

• The cast and ensemble were great. Even the cgi dwarves. Vocally great, and I have little to complain about.
Sure, it would have been way better to have actual people in this role rather than the cgi versions- we have actors who are small in stature, this would have been the perfect opportunity to fill these roles with actual humans! 
Gal Gadot, not at all who I would have thought would fit this role but she was great! And you can tell she gave it a lot! I enjoyed it throughly. 

By the midway point of the film, it became apparent to me that this film has garnered a lot of hate and regality because she has spoken out in a less than ideal way about the storyline and narrative on the original. Not ideal gf. But the end result was something my 6 year old and i enjoyed, the messaging was positive overall, and the performance was engaging, 
If you are hating.. perhaps you need a holiday.

There’s been a lot of backlash about the storyline being ""too woke"" or overly feminist. But at its core, it's a classic tale: a brave young girl defeats an evil queen with the help of others and is saved by man who loves her. There’s nothing controversial about that in my view.

Disney clearly tried to navigate this carefully, considering today's social climate.

The only change I found overly politically correct was the reasoning behind Snow White’s name. In the original tales, she’s called that because of her pale skin and dark hair — a simple contrast. In the film, it’s explained that she was born during a snowstorm. That felt unnecessary and, to me, even a little racist to suggest it is somehow wrong to be white person just based on the colour of her skin. I think it does not set a good message.

There's also been a lot of noise about the casting choice for Snow White, especially regarding her skin tone as I believe her ancerstry if latin american. But “Snow White” is a metaphor. Even the original illustrations didn’t intend for her to be literally white as a wall — that wouldn’t look natural. The film even subtly adjusted her appearance to echo the character’s look. I don’t see that as racist at all. In fact, calling it out as such feels more racially charged than the casting itself as again, there is nothing wrong to have certain colour of skin. 

At its heart, the story is still about a kind and courageous girl who earns the friendship of others and, through that, triumphs over evil. The love story element was toned down, which I think works better in a live-action context. The original version was quite straightforward and may not have translated well today. I actually liked how they reimagined the ""prince"" as a commoner and built up his character with more depth of struggle of the evil queen's ruling and famine.

Unfortunately, this also shows how much damage a lead actor's off-screen comments can do to the perception of a film. It's a shame, because the movie itself had a lot of heart and creativity behind it.","You and 10 other people found this helpful.","10 people found this helpful."

This film is an absolute disaster from start to finish!! A complete insult to the source material and a waste of time, money, and effort for everyone involved.

First, the plot is a jumbled mess. The pacing is atrocious, key moments from the original story are either completely butchered or removed, and the few changes they made were for the worse. It feels like the writers had no clue what made the original work great and instead turned it into a generic, uninspired cash grab.

The acting? Laughable. The cast either overacts to the point of cringe or delivers their lines so flatly that even background extras seem more alive. Not even the most talented actors could salvage this train wreck with such a terrible script.

The special effects are another disaster. For a movie with a high budget, everything looks cheap and unfinished. The CGI is so bad it feels like a low-budget TV show from decades ago. At times, it’s hard to tell if this was meant to be a serious film or an unintentional parody.

And let’s talk about the direction. Whoever was in charge clearly had no vision, no respect for the original story, and no idea how to create a compelling film. Every scene drags on, the emotional moments fall completely flat, and the action (if you can even call it that) is so poorly choreographed that it becomes laughable.

This is, without a doubt, one of the worst adaptations ever made. It disrespects fans, wastes the audience’s time, and proves that not every story needs a Hollywood treatment. Do yourself a favor avoid this disaster at all costs. Do not support this mess.","You and 55 other people found this helpful.","55 people found this helpful."

This had to be the worst Disney movie I’ve ever seen. It was so bad and they absolutely massacred this princess. Rachel Zeglar was so out of it and it just looked like she was trying to act the whole time and not getting lost in the princess. I guess that was given how she shit talked the princess, prince, and the entire story in general. However, she can sing, I can’t shit talk her talent to sing but I can shit talk her talent to act because she has none. Gal Gadot, the smoke show queen has to pretend to be jealous of Rachel Zegler, which is just a major plot hole. So instead of looks they tried to make it so she was jealous of her personality? Bizarre. This is by far Gal Gadot’s worst work. You can tell she’s out of it, and almost like her acting shows that she already knew the film was going to bomb. Speaking of bizarre, borderline horrifying were the dwarfs. These CGI dwarfs were actually scary. Good thing they didn’t arrive until half way through the movie because Jesus they’re pure nightmare fuel. Why would you not use real people with dwarfism? With personality and humanity? Overall this is a 0/5 but I can’t rate it that low unfortunately. A more detailed breakdown would be as follows….
Plot: 0/5 - they butchered the story, and the plot was like nails on a chalkboard. 
Acting: 0/5 - I’m pretty sure the magic mirror told the cast the film would bomb and the acting was so low effort
CGI: 0/5 - horrifying nightmare fuel, will scare your child
Singing: 2/5 - I hate to say it but Rachel can sing, but she can’t act at all. Her talent would be best served as a high school theater instructor. But it is a 2/5 because the tune of auto tune was painfully obvious and the songs were forgettable.

Overall this film is a monstrosity and a disgrace to Disney. I can’t believe they released this garbage and didn’t totally can it.","You and 37 other people found this helpful.","37 people found this helpful."

The bandit gang was random, but necessary to introduce the Guy (thank goodness not another Prince) 
And the dwarves as cgi, well, they are magical creatures. So it makes sense. 
Snow White's motivation to fight was reasonable. Her remembering all of them makes her character more lovable i guess. 
Because we all know the old animation do have red some flags (women should be meek, passive, and soft, etc.) 

It may have merged all those Snow White inspired stories, not the most original.

Let's start with the obvious, why is this even called Snow White when it has none of what made the original iconic? No dwarfs? No timeless charm? No classic romance? Instead, we get a self-proclaimed fearless leader who spends more time lecturing than being, you know… an actual character. Snow White used to be about kindness and resilience but now she’s an uninspired, rebellious heroine with all the depth of a TikTok monologue.
The Evil Queen? She’s practically the only reason this movie gets 1 star. If anyone deserved a tragic backstory and more screen time, it was her. Instead, we get a villain overshadowed by…well, everything else wrong with this film.
And let’s talk about the script. It feels like AI-generated corporate feminism, where every line tries to sound “empowering” but comes off as force-fed activism with zero emotional depth. It’s not about strong female characters and it’s about turning a beloved fairy tale into a lifeless Twitter thread.
The visuals? It’s like Disney put all their budget into VFX but forgot the soul. The cinematography is gorgeous, but even that can’t save a movie with the emotional engagement of a soggy rice cake.
Bottom line: If you loved the original Snow White, this movie is like watching someone take your childhood, run it through a bland, corporate AI filter, and then lecture you about why you're supposed to love it.

Then there’s the Evil Queen, who seems less evil and more like she's annoyed she missed her morning coffee. Her motivations are so unclear that by the end, I was rooting for the mirror just to shatter and put us all out of our misery.

And let’s talk about those dwarfs. Seven of them. All introduced in a blur of terrible CGI beards and one-liners that wouldn't even make a kindergarten class giggle. I didn’t learn their names, because I was too distracted trying to figure out why one was clearly just a kid in a beard and another looked suspiciously like he wandered in from a different movie set.

The forest animals, clearly rendered on a 2006 laptop, might be the most expressive characters in the entire movie, which is both impressive and depressing.

The pacing? Glacial. The plot? Practically non-existent. The climax? I blinked and missed it. Twice.

I went into this live-action Snow White with cautious optimism, hoping for at least a respectful reimagining of one of Disney’s most beloved classics. What I got instead was a film that stripped away the very soul of the original, leaving behind a joyless, hollow, and utterly baffling mess.

First and foremost, Snow White is no longer the character generations have known and loved. The innocence, kindness, and warmth that made her so iconic? Gone. Instead, we’re given a forced “strong leader” archetype, as if her original virtues weren’t good enough. Snow White was never about power or conquest—her story was about kindness, resilience, and finding hope in the darkest of times. But this film rewrites her into something unrecognizable, making her feel more like a generic fantasy protagonist than the timeless character we grew up with.

And then there are the bandits. Who thought this was a good idea? They were so unnecessary and irrelevant to the plot that I kept wondering if I had missed something crucial. Were they meant to replace the dwarfs? Were they supposed to serve as comic relief? Sidekicks? A resistance force? The movie never bothers to explain or justify their existence, leaving them as nothing more than an odd and pointless addition that drags the story down.

But perhaps the biggest insult of all was the removal of some of Snow White’s most iconic songs. I’m Wishing / One Song? Gone. Someday My Prince Will Come? Erased. With a Smile and a Song? Nowhere to be found. These weren’t just background melodies; they were deeply woven into the heart of the original film, capturing Snow White’s optimism, her dreams, and her gentle spirit. Stripping them away in favor of generic, forgettable replacements is not just disappointing—it’s downright disrespectful to the legacy of Disney animation.

This film didn’t just fail as an adaptation; it failed as a story in general. It didn’t respect its source material, it didn’t offer anything compelling in return, and it felt like a cynical, soulless rehash of a masterpiece that deserved far better.

AND.... Snow white is so woke. In the oryginal, she crashed at dwarfs, slept there, and felt safe, because she was almost murdered. As a token of a gratitude that she actually broke into someone's house, she cleaned it and cooked the meal for dwarfs, unaware of her presence in their house. Kind. Not sexist. Kind.

This snow white starts giving orders straight away, sings the song, gives dwarfs tools, and tells them to clean their own house, that she just broke into... as she sings, she takes a cloth, it looks like she's going to do some work and.. gives it to another dwarf...

She just comes across as a little 'hardened' even 'mean', although she can certainly act and sing but something's off. I think another huge mistake was to change the original story and remove the Prince and replace it with a 'Robin Hood' character. One of the things that defined the original story is the Prince and the song 'One Day my Prince will Come'. People still want that and it's removal because someone decided he was too much like a 'stalker' is ridiculous. It's a shame because Disney were close to getting this one right.  6/10","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Disney has been flopping with a lot of re-imagined classics and the only one I truly enjoy is beauty and the beast, all others have mostly been a flop due to not sticking to the original, either with storyline or song. That being said - I will start with my review of Snow White.

I didn’t like it. It started off and continued with many unfamiliar songs that I grew up with when I was young. The magic of the movie from my 30 plus years of life was never sparked. There was some added storyline with the parents that I just couldn’t connect with because it wasn’t emphasized in the original story- or maybe at least not enough for me to care. I didnt feel like Rachel was the right part for this movie - I’m not sure if I just don’t like the energy maybe she seems to naturally have (maybe that’s a personal problem) in these movies (not speaking of the real world Rachel) but I just don’t think I like her and tbh I can’t put a finger on it as to why.  Maybe seemingly narcissistic? Seemingly acts too longing with her facial and body portayels? Ya she can sing but her voice annoys me more than anything- and this is my own completely unbiased feelings. 

There are other things I didn’t like which included some parts of the Queen seemed like narratives I wasn’t feeling were from the original, then she sings and yes I like Gal ad an actress but again I was just not excited for this add on from the original version , I think mostly the new songs in this movie didn’t add anything for me with the narrative or magic but in general was just annoying to the point where I literally skipped every song- and also how she died I was like what just happened.. 

and the relationship between Snow White and the prince were not at all strong for me and though lots of prince and princess Disney stories are the same - gosh it just seemed repetitive and dry….. 

I did hear that people questioned why they didn’t used real life dwarves to play the dwarves—— this actually I’m super bothered with once I saw, and made me even more disturbed the more I watched it. The reason because 1. Why did they animate the dwarves instead of using real life dwarves ?? We are in the age of inclusion and we are past the point of having little people act as their own respectful person. 2. They had the audacity to actually cast one real life little person BUT NOT AS A DWARF??? Just as another towns person ??? Hello what am I freaking missing ??","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Instead of changing old fairy tales to fit modern narratives, why not create new ones that empower girls and women in fresh, meaningful ways? By rewriting Snow White instead of celebrating what made it special, this remake loses the timeless magic that made the original a beloved classic.","You and 187 other people found this helpful.","187 people found this helpful."

Rachel can sing. Her hair looks terrible. Most of the memes showing online didn't even happen in the movie. She was named Snow White because she was born on a stormy winter night. Fair is meant to describe her as a person. Kind and fair, unlike the evil queen. Those who have a problem with her skin color need to really review their life decisions. 

The dwarves are..weird. They are cgi. The idea behind that was to make them look as authentic to the original dwarves as possible. They succeeded. It's a bit jarring when you 1st see them on screen, but it's adaptable.

Gal Gadot is clearly more beautiful than Rachel, but that wasn't the point of the story. This felt like a step down for Gal in terms of other movies she's played in. Also, she cannot sing. 

No, they're is no prince she will happily marry and live happily ever after with. Good. We needed a more realistic female role. In the original, snow White was a dreamy eyed puppy. At least she's got some back bone in this version. And technically, she still ends up with the guy.

Her line delivery fell flat and failed to deliver the intimidation and cunning of the original Evil Queen. 
I would also like to address the elephant in the room that was the dwarves: they were horrible to look at and it is beyond disappointing that for a movie that had so much blatantly forced diversity, they purposely chose not to cast any little people for fear of offending audiences. I am not a little person, however, they are rarely represented in major roles and this would have been an excellent oppurtunity for any little person actors.

From the very beginning, it became clear that this film wasn’t just a poor remake—it was a misguided attempt to “modernize” a beloved classic, completely missing the essence of what made the original so special. Snow White, portrayed by Rachel Zegler, is a far cry from the kind, hopeful character we all know.

The writers’ attempt to turn her into a “modern, empowered woman” stripped away all relatability, leaving behind a character that felt more like a lecture than a fairy tale heroine.

The film's creative choices are baffling and ultimately leave you wondering how anyone thought these decisions were a good idea. The dwarfs are replaced with random, awkwardly diverse magical companions who serve no purpose other than to tick diversity boxes. They have no depth, no chemistry, and fail to add anything meaningful to the story. The Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot, is the only remotely tolerable part of the film, but even her performance is weighed down by laughable dialogue and motivations. It’s hard to take her seriously as a villain when her jealousy is written as if it came straight from a middle school diary.

As if the character choices weren’t enough, the visuals and storyline are a slap in the face to the original. The forest scenes look like something out of a cheap green-screened production, and Snow White’s iconic dress is transformed into a washed-out, poorly designed costume. The story is watered down into a preachy, joyless lecture on self-love, with no romance, no magic, and no emotional payoff. In the end, I felt like I’d thrown my time, money, and energy away on a film that only served to mock its predecessor.

Once a timeless classic rooted in emotional depth and unforgettable charm, this new iteration feels like a lifeless shell—beautiful on the outside, but strangely hollow within.
To be fair, the backdrops and environmental details are meticulously crafted. The world is vibrant, the sets visually rich, and it’s clear a great deal of effort went into the look of the film. But this attention to detail only underscores the glaring absence of what truly matters: a compelling story with emotional weight. For all its beauty, Snow White lacks a soul.
Disney seems unsure of what they were aiming for with this film. It plays like a watered-down version of itself, stripped of the sincerity and complexity that made the original beloved across generations. The story never dives below the surface. Instead, it relies heavily on bright colors, exaggerated expressions, and one-note emotions—often feeling more like a theme park ride promo than a cinematic experience. It panders to the youngest possible audience, leaving older viewers—who also grew up with the magic of Disney—completely unengaged.
The seven dwarfs were reimagined with a unique look, but the overuse of CGI made them feel more like video game NPCs than real characters. It’s a strange creative decision when films like Beauty and the Beast have already shown how to successfully balance realism with fantasy. Here, everything feels artificial—polished, yes, but emotionally empty.
What’s most frustrating is how the film seems to underestimate its audience. There’s an almost patronizing simplicity to the dialogue and themes, as if the filmmakers assumed viewers wouldn’t notice the lack of substance. But we notice. And it stings.
The music, too, was unremarkable—forgettable at best and awkward at worst. There was no signature moment, no emotional swell that evoked that classic Disney feeling we all long for. It all felt manufactured, as if it were trying to check off boxes rather than touch hearts.
It’s devastating to see such a treasured story reduced to this. Disney once knew how to tell stories that resonated deeply across age, culture, and time. This version of Snow White feels like it was created by committee rather than by storytellers who care. The magic is gone, replaced with glossy visuals and empty smiles.
For a studio that built its legacy on heart, wonder, and timeless storytelling, this film is a painful reminder of how far it’s strayed. In trying to reinvent a classic, they’ve forgotten what made it matter in the first place.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Snow White although a classic is not one of disney biggest story.  The age group that grew up with it is dying; so capturing a new audience can be challenging. However if they would've promoted some of those songs they may have gotten a larger turn out.

I appreciate that. Disney has brought happiness and sadness in my life and countless other emotions. One thing I will appreciate from Disney would be the live actions (despite mainstream media not caring for the live actions). I think that the live actions tell a same story with different areas that haven’t been explored. One of my favorites will always be Maleficent, Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Little Mermaid. my number one favorite movie that Disney has made in terms of live action is The Little Mermaid.



Despite mainstream media heavily critiquing each Disney live action, I have found a room in my heart to allow the new narrative into my life. 



I have recently watched the Snow White movie that Disney has released, and I am utterly disappointed. It is almost shameful that Disney has released this movie for the following reasons: 



1 - The plot

2- The singing 

3 - Opportunity 



each Disney live action that I have watched thus far has somewhat stuck to the original plot. But I cannot say the same thing for Snow White. Nothing in the movie speak Snow White nor does it reflect the original Disney princess in anyway. I understand that this is a new story and it’s about independence and being your own leader. But the fact that there are very little similarities between the cartoon from 1937 and the new version of 2025 is deeply saddening. I was expecting more from Disney as a budget was 300 million USD. One seen in particular in particular that was lacking was how the evil queen died. In the original, she died via falling off a cliff. In the live action, she proceeded to die by turning black and freezing. I came into the movie with a positive attitude and ignoring all media opinions but that is not acceptable in any way as Disney has misunderstood their own plot that they have delivered since 1937. 





despite Rachel Zegler being a fabulous singer and actress, I don’t think that the singing style that she was told to sing in reflected Snow White as a princess. She had an amazing voice. But I don’t think Whistle While You Work really hit the spot. I am not gonna attack Rachel as she does not deserve it, but what I can recommend is Disney producers try to stick to the original Melody as as much as possible. In the song, hi ho, there was a couple parts of the original song that weren’t there, but other than that high ho was okay. However, the new songs are also okay. I am not impressed with the songwriting skills nor am I impressed with the way the actors had delivered them. Each actor was talented (apart from Gal Gadot) in the movie, but I think that there was minimal effort put into Snow White. I did not like the new songs at all. 



I understand Disney’s new objectives of evolving as a company and I know that Disney wants to be as inclusive as possible, and I have seen efforts being put in. But what Disney should have done is hiring little people instead of CGI versions of the seven dwarfs. this would’ve been the perfect opportunity for Disney and I know for a fact there were aspiring actors waiting for this role. Disney also shouldn’t have hired Gal Gadot as the evil queen due to her ability of not knowing how to properly deliver lines in a movie.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Stripping away the beloved songs and the iconic presence of Prince Charming robs the story of its heart. Instead, we’re left with a hollow shell of what once was, replaced by a narrative that feels more like a lecture on modern values than a tale of fantasy and wonder.

The production’s controversies and divisive direction, even before cameras started rolling, set a tone of skepticism among Disney loyalists. Rachel Zegler’s portrayal fails to capture the essence of the titular character, making it hard for audiences to connect with this so-called ""Snow White."" 

Above all, this film symbolizes Disney turning its back on its cultural heritage. In pursuing an agenda labeled ""progressive,"" they’ve forsaken the artistry, tradition, and timeless appeal that built their reputation. What could have been a tasteful homage to a classic is instead an uninspired, heavy-handed commentary that does little to honor its roots.

This remake is a glaring reminder that some stories deserve respect, not reinvention. Unfortunately, one star is all this film has earned—and even that feels generous.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

Unlike the 1937 movie, where Snow White shelters herself because she is scared to face her stepmother, the remake version of Snow White is fearless leader who isn't afraid to fight to restore the kingdom. Is my child mature and old enough to watch this movie? - Expect a few disturbing moments, most notably the final battle, Snow White falling into the hole and drowning for a bit, Snow White being poisoned and Evil Queen's transformation scene. Despite this, when Snow White falls and drowns is partially like how it was in the original movie, and as for when Snow White is poisoned and when Evil Queen turns into an old woman is only very little to not being creepier than the original version. The final battle scene, particularly the final moments of the final battle might be scary for very young children. As for the romance parts of the movie, there are some flirting and kissing scenes, but it's not really that disturbing. While there are some rude scenes, most notably verbal insults, food fighting and bullying one of the dwarfes, Snow White lightens the tone by being a good role model to everyone who were being mean and argumentative.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

The character of the Queen is completely ruined by the acting and what they did with the character. They made her absolutely ridiculous and I couldn’t take her for serious. The auto tuning is so heavy that you can hear each sound which Gal Didn’t get.

None of the characters or actors had a chemistry except the little Snow White and the parents at the beginning of the movie. Each actor played her/his role like they received the script just five minutes ago and it seemed  like” okay let’s just try it”
No one Held the character and none of the characters had any character development. For me, it was not possible to build a sympathy for the storyline and the character
The dialogues absolutely senseless

Rachel‘s voice was absolutely stunning !! Sadly her acting was as worse as the others ,overacted , fake and absolutely wrong for Snow. But it fitted with the rest of the cast.

I won’t talk about the CGI dwarfs… that was like Horror puppets. I was so sad that the dwarfs weren’t humans. They were a couple of scenes where I thought wow this could be so amazing if you would have had chose to cast real people.
Sadly Rachel wasn’t able To act like there were real dwarfs. You recognised in the first second that she played for herself 

The made a feminist out of snow and within all is about political things 

The costumes - like from a carnival shop

It has nothing to do with the Snow White form 1937- the old great fairytale is destroyed in this version.
I will hold on to the Old classical movies 

This movie gets one star for the positive things :
1) The animals were super cute 
2) Rachel’s Voice absolutely wonderful 
3) some songs like “ waiting on a wish and whistle

*Snow White (2025)* isn’t just bad—it’s an embarrassing, joyless cash grab that spits in the face of one of Disney’s most beloved films. Every ounce of heart, wonder, and magic from the 1937 classic has been stripped away, leaving behind a hollow, corporate Frankenstein of a movie that fails on every level.  

Let’s start with the worst part: the writing. The dialogue is so forced and awkward that it feels like AI-generated nonsense. The story—if you can even call it that—drags along with no real stakes, no emotion, and no charm. Snow White herself is the most lifeless, uninspiring protagonist I’ve seen in a Disney movie, delivering lines with all the enthusiasm of someone reading a tax form. The Evil Queen, who should be dripping with menace and elegance, is reduced to a generic villain with zero presence.  

Then there’s the visuals—oh boy, the visuals. The CGI is so bad it makes early 2000s video games look impressive. The sets look like cheap theme park attractions, and the costumes somehow manage to be both gaudy and forgettable at the same time. Even the musical numbers, which should be a highlight, are completely soulless, with forgettable compositions that sound like they were thrown together in an afternoon.  

Disney has officially lost the plot. Instead of respecting their legacy, they’ve churned out yet another lazy, uninspired remake designed purely to squeeze money out of nostalgia. This movie is an insult to the original *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* and a slap in the face to anyone who still believes in Disney magic.

Lucy Hale or Dove Cameron  would've made a much better Snow White than some random 23 year old. They also would've APPRECIATED their roles much better. If you look at all the other live action Disney Princesses, they were more than thrilled and honored to be in those roles. Don't get me wrong I wasn't a big fan at the fact that Ariel in the live action Little Mermaid was African American either, but at least she loved her role, loved the original, and tried to keep the essence of the original still in then live action.

He has no significant role in this ""story"", I kept forgetting he was there and what he was actually doing besides being arested and stuff. They might have deleted him there. She was also right about the ""love story"" there is nothing about love there. 
In nutshell the plot starts as we know, snow white lives in a castle with jealous step mother. When her life is in danger she escapes meets 7 dwarfs....after that point she meets some bandits and goes to save her dad....or I'm not sure what exactly was the second part of the story and I refuse to watch it again!!
The dwarfs after watching the movie are terrible, but I don't think they are even the worst. I think the CGI feels at times like it's been done 20 years ago or they made it all done by AI. You can spot the mistakes and it's just terrible. 
Costume and make-up department besides the Evil Queen did pretty average or bellow average job. Even in crappy movies I can generally appreciate the costumes and makeup ...but here NOPE. And despite the fact that Rachel is a big xplitive she still can look amazing and princess like, so it's not her fault she looks so bad in most of the movie. 

I would suggest to anyone who still want to see it, to be prepared to either lose the money or stream it online. It's that bad.

Rachel Zegler, as much as I wanted to root for her, was simply unlikable (think, Rachel Berry!). She and her love interest had zero chemistry, making their romance feel forced and lifeless.

Gal Gadot, undeniably striking as the Evil Queen, could have been a highlight. Unfortunately, under Marc Webb’s weak direction, she was reduced to little more than a caricature, over the top, theatrical, and ultimately ineffective.

Then there’s the addition of the “modern” bandits a transparent attempt at inclusivity that only felt awkward and unnecessary. The fact that one little person was included among them, interacting with the CGI dwarfs, was especially baffling. Speaking of the dwarfs, they were the film’s one redeeming quality. Dopey, in particular, stole the show with his adorable CGI presence.

Visually, the film was an absolute mess. The village and exterior castle set looked like they were built on a TV budget, with embarrassingly corny extras that made every crowd scene feel like a theme park reenactment. The forest sequences were even worse, completely disjointed, as if each of its several scenes were designed by a different team with no cohesive vision. One moment, it’s grounded and realistic; the next, it’s else-worldly. The extreme close-ups of Zegler only made things worse, amplifying her distracting facial contortions, not just during musical numbers but in general, making even her simplest expressions painfully awkward to watch.

In the end, Snow White is a prime example of what happens when a studio prioritizes messaging over storytelling, choosing the wrong director, resulting in a soulless, joyless misfire that not even nostalgia can salvage.","You and 15 other people found this helpful.","15 people found this helpful."

The film is a woke piece of trash, plain and simple. It seems as if the writers and producers held a marathon of meetings, combing through the original 1937 masterpiece with a fine-tooth comb, determined to sniff out every last whiff of traditionalism, charm, and timeless storytelling — only to turn it all on its head, scrub it out, or twist it beyond recognition.

Why else would you change so much that didn’t need changing? The original Snow White was a classic, cherished across generations, and if handled with even a shred of respect, this remake could’ve been a massive hit. Instead, they torched it. And how do you screw something up this badly unless it’s intentional?

This movie isn’t just bad — it’s subversive. It reeks of the same smug, hollow virtue-signaling that has infected so much of modern entertainment. But really, should we be surprised when we look at who’s running Disney these days? Poor Walt must be rolling in his grave. They took a fairy tale and turned it into a lecture. And in doing so, they lost the magic.

The only silver lining in this entire debacle is the poetic justice of Disney hiring the extremely woke Rachel Zegler — only to watch her go completely off-script, vocally accusing Israel of genocide and reportedly forcing the producer to meet with her in private to beg her to tone it down. That, at least, is a beautiful ending — a fitting final scene in this slow-motion train wreck of a film.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Title: A Bland and Overrated Fairy Tale

“Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” is often hailed as a classic, but honestly, it’s one of the most overrated fairy tales ever. The story is painfully predictable, with a heroine who has almost zero personality beyond being “kind and beautiful.” Snow White spends most of the movie being helpless whether it’s running away, cleaning up after seven grown men, or falling into a coma waiting for a prince to magically solve all her problems.

Title: A Bland and Overrated Fairy Tale

“Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” is often hailed as a classic, but honestly, it’s one of the most overrated fairy tales ever. The story is painfully predictable, with a heroine who has almost zero personality beyond being “kind and beautiful.” Snow White spends most of the movie being helpless whether it’s running away, cleaning up after seven grown men, or falling into a coma waiting for a prince to magically solve all her problems.

The villain, the Evil Queen, is at least interesting, but her motivation is ridiculously shallow. She has all this dark magic at her disposal, yet she wastes it on eliminating a teenager just because she’s slightly prettier? And don’t get me started on the dwarfs they’re more like a group of goofy mascots than actual characters.

The pacing drags, the songs are forgettable, and the “true love’s kiss” resolution is not only lazy but also kind of creepy. For a film that’s supposedly a milestone in animation, it hasn’t aged well in terms of storytelling. If you’re looking for a truly engaging fairy tale, there are far better options out there.","You and 20 other people found this helpful.","20 people found this helpful."

Regarding the seven dwarfs, I know that a lot has changed over time and with technology. Stories evolve, the world changes, and movies need to keep up with that. I believe that people with dwarfism should appear in movies and have space, but I understand that Disney wanted to do something different. Maybe they made some mistakes, but that's part of the process of change.

Overall, even though I'm not a fan of the princess universe, I thought this movie was cool and I liked the idea.

Back in the FIFA 12 Road to Glory days, it was just a standard, respectable forehead. But as the years passed, something changed. With each diss track, each boxing match, each Prime promotion, his forehead seemed to expand—absorbing more space, more knowledge, and possibly the souls of his defeated opponents.

Some say it’s fueled by the sheer amount of forehead jokes, growing in defiance like a boss-level Pokémon. Others claim that his forehead is actually a secret energy source, storing all the untapped potential of Sidemen videos left on the cutting room floor. There’s even a theory that each time Jake Paul dodges a fight, KSI’s forehead gains another millimeter of power.

At this rate, by 2030, we may need a separate time zone just for KSI’s forehead. NASA is already considering launching satellites into its orbit. Whatever the cause, one thing is certain—his forehead is on a mission, and we are merely spectators to its unstoppable expansion.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

I wish that more actors can be like Tom Cruise! Who do not even talk about politics as their being interviewed for movies.

Actors and actresses, no one cares about your political views!

This isn’t about race, it’s about preserving the integrity of heritage stories. Altering her background in the name of progressiveness doesn’t feel inclusive; it feels like cultural substitution. 

I support telling diverse stories and creating new characters from underrepresented cultures, but I believe this film lost the essence of what made Snow White special in the first place.

The original fairy tale clearly describes Snow White as having “skin as white as snow,” a detail that is central to her identity—not just aesthetically, but symbolically. Recasting this role in a way that directly contradicts that foundational description feels like a dismissal of the character’s cultural and literary roots.

What’s more disappointing is that the performances themselves lacked the magic and depth needed to carry such an iconic tale. The film felt hollow, overly focused on modern messaging rather than timeless storytelling. It didn’t feel like a reimagining; it felt like a departure.

Diversity in film is important, but not at the expense of rewriting established cultural characters. Instead of changing legacy figures, Disney should focus on creating new, authentic characters that reflect today’s world without copying and pasting over history.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

And let’s talk about personality. The Queen had drive, ambition, and standards. Snow White? She trusted every stranger she met and spent most of her screen time cleaning up after seven lazy men. The Queen deserved better. Honestly, if I were her, I’d be furious too.

The dwarfs were a complete disaster. They looked like characters ripped straight from The Polar Express, with an unsettling, lifeless quality. What makes it worse is that the film actually featured actors with dwarfism in other minor roles but chose not to cast them as the iconic seven dwarfs. It felt like a baffling and frustrating decision.

Gal Gadot, who played the Evil Queen, was another major weak point. Her acting was unconvincing, her singing was rough, and any attempt to be menacing came across as unintentionally goofy. The story itself was poorly paced—it dragged in places where it shouldn’t, and the only moment that moved quickly was Snow White’s death, which bizarrely lasted a mere five minutes of screen time.

The prince was yet another missed opportunity. He wasn’t even portrayed as a proper prince and felt more like a token love interest who was sidelined for about 80% of the film. He had no real personality or purpose beyond being there because the story required it. As for the music? Aside from ""Whistle While You Work,"" nearly every song was forgettable or just plain bad.

Ultimately, Snow White was doomed from the start. The story is a mess, Gal Gadot is miscast as the Evil Queen, and the seven dwarfs feel like cheap knock-offs. The only saving grace was Snow White herself—but even her strong performance couldn’t stop the rest of the film from falling apart.

Then there’s the absolute creative genius behind the decision to get rid of the dwarfs.

Disney’s been on a mission to suck the soul out of its classics, and this one might be their magnum opus of mediocrity. It’s less Snow White and more Woke White and the Seven Diversity Hires.

The movie was good, funny, and I did enjoy the storyline. It has some good learning moments for children, if you grew up with the original I wouldn’t expect anything if I were you. 
Gal Gadot is drop dead gorgeous there’s no way in this movie can Snow White be fairer than her. It is said later though Snow White had a beautiful heart so maybe that’s the point. Which I did like. Gal Gadot was amazing as the evil queen! I loved her costume, her makeup, her nails, and especially her crown! They gave her a musical number which I enjoyed. The Dwarves were adorable even though they were animated. 
I have nothing against Rachel Ziegler she’s very beautiful and has a very beautiful voice, but her acting was eh and they did her dirty with that haircut! I like that she was Latina even though that’s not what her name stood for, but in the movie they give her name a different reason. 

However it is not a live action remake. It’s nothing like the original. The original is so pure and beautiful! I think Walt would be ashamed! Sorry not sorry! I was very disappointed.

-I liked that they brought the apples into the beginning of the movie so it was a consistent motif.

-They had a few good callbacks (the way she dances, the scary forest scene, etc) 

-I’m glad that it was a true musical with dancing

- I think the top of her dress was pretty good 
 

The bad:

- The dwarves were super uncanny. Especially Dopey. 

- her love interest is awful in all aspects. There was no chemistry. There was no reason to make him a thief instead of a prince. 
It just seems like they wanted another Flynn rider. His character is boring, his costume design looks downright modern and weird, and even his name is super out of place in the fantasy setting. 

- the entire crew of bandits were pretty much pointless. 

-Bottom of her dress was truly horrendous.  The original is like a slightly yellow creme colored, smooth fabric. The new one is neon yellow party city tulle. 
 
-the set made the kingdom looked tiny. Like a maximum of 70 people lived there. 

-the queen’s costume is horrendous 

-I think they tried to make her less condescending toward the dwarves  by deleting a lot of the parts where she treated them like children, but then they added a new part where feels even more infantilizing toward them/

This isn’t a modern update—it’s a full-blown assassination of everything that made the original film timeless, magical, and loved for generations. Instead of giving audiences a faithful adaptation, Disney force-fed us another preachy, politically correct mess that strips away every ounce of fun and charm. The entire movie feels like it was written by people who despise fairy tales and think classic stories need to be ""fixed"" to fit their agenda. The result?

Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen, though visually striking, never reaches the level of menace or complexity that could have made her a truly compelling antagonist.

Beyond performances, the film’s biggest issue is its muddled storytelling. In an effort to modernize the tale, it removes core elements without offering meaningful replacements. The absence of the Prince and the introduction of new side characters feel like changes made for the sake of change rather than to strengthen the narrative. The new songs, while serviceable, lack the memorable quality of Disney’s best musical numbers.

Even if we judge Snow White as a standalone film rather than a remake, it still falls short. The pacing is inconsistent, character development feels thin, and the emotional moments fail to land. Rather than feeling like a bold reimagining, it comes across as unsure of what it wants to be. While the film’s visual effects and production design have their moments, they can’t compensate for the lack of heart and depth in the storytelling.

This could have been a chance to reintroduce Snow White to a new generation in a meaningful way, but unfortunately, it’s a missed opportunity that struggles to justify its own existence.

Disney’s latest reimagining of Snow White tried to flip the script—and the glass slipper—but ended up stumbling over its own muddled messaging and uncanny CGI.

Let’s start with what worked (barely): the mirror and the Evil Queen’s transformation. The mirror scenes had that classic eerie charm, and the final act—when the Queen morphs into the hag and poisons the apple—was genuinely chilling. The cinematography leaned into the gothic, and for a moment, you remembered why this story became a legend.

Unfortunately, everything else? A confusing mess.

The so-called ""prince"" is now a bandit—because of course he is. It’s a not-so-subtle attempt to toss out traditional fairytale tropes in the name of girl power, but in doing so, it strips the story of its heart. The charm of Snow White was always in its romantic idealism and innocence, not some half-baked lesson in independence. If you're going to ditch the prince, at least give us something compelling in return. Instead, we get vague rebellion, wooden characters, and no emotional payoff.

The lead actress felt oddly miscast. She didn’t embody the softness or wonder that Snow White needs. And Gal Gadot, while stunning, never fully sells the wickedness of the Evil Queen. She looks the part—every frame she’s in is styled to perfection—but the menace just isn’t there.

Then there’s the music. It’s a musical, technically, but none of the songs leave a lasting impression. They feel flat, forgettable, and completely disconnected from the emotion of the scenes. You’ll be hard-pressed to remember a single melody the moment the credits roll.

And let’s talk about those dwarves. The CGI is disturbingly realistic—so much so that it crosses into uncanny valley territory. Their proportions are off, and instead of feeling endearing or magical, they’re just… creepy. The charm, whimsy, and warmth from the original characters is gone, replaced with digital husks that feel more like background extras in a horror film.

In trying so hard to modernize Snow White, Disney lost what made it timeless. You can reimagine a fairytale without gutting its soul—but this film doesn’t manage that.

Rating: 1.5/5 poisoned apples. 
Just watch the original. Or better yet, read the Brothers Grimm version if you're in the mood for something truly dark and satisfying.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Snow White, the heart of the story, comes across as more annoyed than enchanting, and the villain? Let’s just say I’ve seen scarier performances in middle school plays.

The visuals, which should be a highlight in a fantasy film, are somehow both overproduced and lifeless.

I went into Snow White (2025) hoping for a fresh, modern take on a beloved classic. What I got instead was a confusing, politically overloaded mess that forgot what made the original so timeless. The heart, the charm, the fantasy—it’s all been stripped away and replaced with a preachy tone and awkward dialogue.

Let’s talk about casting. Rachael Zegler as Snow White was a bold choice, but unfortunately, not a good one. Her portrayal lacked the grace, warmth, and elegance you’d expect from a fairytale princess. And, to be blunt, she just doesn’t embody the ethereal beauty or charm the character is known for. At times, her demeanor and presentation felt more at home in an edgy indie drama than in a Disney fairy tale. Honestly, she looked more like a TikTok activist than someone you'd cast as ""the fairest of them all.""

The dwarfs? Oh wait, scratch that—no dwarfs here. Just a ragtag bunch of generic sidekicks who felt more like a checklist of modern diversity tropes than meaningful characters. The magic was missing. The whimsy was gone. And don't get me started on the pacing—it dragged like a Monday morning.

Disney tried so hard to be ""progressive"" that they lost the very soul of the story. Sometimes, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel—you just need to roll it with care. And Snow White (2025)? That wheel came off halfway down the hill.

It’s bland, lifeless, and filled with cringeworthy dialogue that feels like it was written by a committee trying too hard to be modern and “empowering.” Instead of capturing the charm and magic of the classic tale, the movie strips away everything that made Snow White special, leaving behind a soulless, uninspired husk.

The casting choices? Questionable at best. The lead actress lacks the charisma and warmth needed for such an iconic role, making it impossible to connect with her character. The chemistry between the cast is nonexistent, and the so-called “dwarfs” are barely relevant. Instead of enhancing the story, they feel like an afterthought, as if the studio was embarrassed to include them in the first place.

And don’t even get me started on the visuals. The CGI is inconsistent, with some scenes looking straight out of a low-budget TV show. The costumes are forgettable, and the set designs feel cheap. This movie had a massive budget, yet somehow, it looks worse than adaptations from decades ago.

Overall, Snow White is a trainwreck. It lacks heart, charm, and any sense of storytelling. It’s yet another example of Hollywood trying to “reinvent” a classic and failing miserably. Save your money and watch literally anything else.

It's a disgrace to culture, history, and tradition, and also one of the worst marketing strategies one could take in promoting a film. It makes no sense to alienate such a large potential audience demographic, therefore ensuring their disinterest in the film, by promoting such a specific agenda. Lastly, the film was simply and objectively poorly done. The acting ability from the main cast was shallow, unimpressive and unconvincing; one sees the actors/actresses and not the characters. Also, in this new plot they've constructed, there are a variety of painfully obvious inconsistencies and things that simply do not make any sense at all. Essentially, in order to enjoy this movie, one must entirely case aside all knowledge and memory of the original story, subscribe to the political agenda this movie promotes, and cast aside all logic and critical thinking.

Despite impressive visual effects and elegant production design, the film struggles to engage viewers, overshadowed by its underwhelming portrayal of the iconic princess.

At the heart of the film’s failures is the casting and execution of Snow White herself, whose depiction lacks both charisma and warmth. A character renowned for her charm and enchantment, Snow White here becomes a strangely energy-draining presence. Far from captivating, her presence feels awkward and forced, undermining the entire film’s tone. Rather than being swept away in a magical retelling, audiences may find themselves struggling to remain seated, experiencing discomfort instead of delight.

In stark contrast, Gal Gadot delivers an outstanding performance as the villain, breathing fresh energy and charm into every scene she commands. Gadot’s vibrant portrayal of malevolent charisma creates a stark disparity, highlighting even more clearly the deficiencies in the film’s lead performance. Her dynamic screen presence serves as a constant reminder of what the film might have been, had the central casting been more thoughtfully considered.

Unfortunately, Gadot alone cannot salvage the overall experience. As Snow White falters, so too does the audience’s patience, culminating in a sense of regret rather than wonder. For those hoping for Disney’s magic at its best, Snow White disappoints profoundly, leaving viewers questioning the value of their theatre ticket.

In conclusion, Disney’s latest remake proves to be a missed opportunity. While Gadot’s villain injects vitality, the film is ultimately burdened by its bland, uninspired protagonist. For many viewers, sitting through this adaptation may feel more like an endurance test than entertainment, making Snow White (2025) difficult to recommend.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Mirror, Mirror, on the wall, this Snow White remake is the most disappointing of them all. Disney’s live-action adaptation of the classic tale is a baffling mess that manages to miss the mark on almost every level.
The film suffers from a lifeless script, lacking the charm and emotional resonance that made the 1937 animated original a masterpiece. The characters, including Snow White herself (portrayed by Rachel Zegler), feel devoid of personality and depth, struggling to connect with audiences. The iconic seven dwarfs are relegated to uninspired, poorly designed CGI caricatures that come across as jarring and unnatural alongside the live-action actors.
The visual effects, surprisingly subpar for a Disney production, often distract rather than immerse, creating an artificial and dull atmosphere instead of a magical one. The new songs are largely forgettable, failing to capture the whimsy and timeless appeal of the original soundtrack. Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen, despite her usual charisma, feels miscast and struggles to convey the menacing presence of the animated villain.
Ultimately, Snow White (2025) feels like a missed opportunity – a soulless cash grab that fails to justify its existence and strips the beloved classic of its magic and heart. It leaves viewers longing for the artistry and charm that defined the 1937 animated film.

She is naturally kind-hearted and gentle, always treating others with warmth and care. Her compassionate nature is evident in how she befriends the forest animals and cares for the Seven Dwarfs, offering to cook and clean in gratitude for their hospitality.Snow White is a romantic dreamer, believing in true love and waiting for her prince to return for her. She has a nurturing and motherly side, especially when caring for the Dwarfs, scolding them gently like a loving parent while also showering them with kindness.

The good news if you haven't seen or didn't like the original this version might be a bit better for you. 

Regardless of the feelings of the original, this film fails on almost every aspect of film and entertainment. 

First, the story is so slow and emotionless that it's difficult to stay engaged, and when parts of the movie are missed there is no desire to rewind. Next the chemistry between the actors is almost nonexistent to the point it's uncomfortable. Then the story has been changed to the point where the events don't really make sense. The songs created for this version seem so deaf to the tone, speed and spot in the movie, it almost seems the songs were written and just by random selection thrown in, not to mentionthe sheer quantity of songs is shocking. The acting was terrible, so bad it's actually sad knowing Disney paid money for it. Finally the over use of glaringly bad CGI is at times distracting and other times cringe worthy. 

Overall, Disney spent around $200m on this, and honestly there are better productions, story lines, acting, and better CGI in Halmark movies.

It seems that blame for the debacle that is Snow White 2025 is trying to be placed in all different directions. However, I think this film fails Top to Bottom, it would be virtually impossible to make a movie this bad without a complete failure at all levels. I wonder if Disney would have lost less money by just canceling prior to release, they could have at least saved on marketing.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

When you try to radicalise children with communist dogma as well as anti-romantic sentiments encouraging children away from family ideals - you’re failing at your role model position. No one wanted this remake to start with, for this rendition of Snow White to have been a success it would have had to not only pay homage to the original essence of the animated Snow White film but also Walt’s dream of bringing children and parents closer together through storytelling that’s engaging, enthralling and morally compelling - at any age. Rachel Zegler is a narcissist - there’s no question. Regardless of her singing talents she has woefully failed to understand her audience - which is families. Campaigning to change a film so beloved it is the foundation of The Walt Disney Company is derangement at its most extreme. This “live action remake” (CGI catastrophe) was a waste of everyone’s time and money and will be a stain on Disney’s legacy. I hope Zegler is ashamed but I highly doubt she has the self awareness to truly understand how disgusting her choices have been. Rachel, you are not anything like the statue of Nike 🙄 - Nike was a work of masterpiece to begin with.

While many elements fail, the most glaring flaw is Gal Gadot’s abysmal performance as the Evil Queen. Despite her star power, Gadot’s portrayal is painfully flat, lacking any menace, depth, or charisma. She delivers her lines with the intensity of a table read, turning one of Disney’s most iconic villains into a laughable, uninspired caricature.

The Evil Queen is supposed to be regal, terrifying, and intoxicatingly wicked. Instead, Gadot’s version comes across as a fashion model trying too hard to be sinister. Her delivery is awkward, her expressions feel forced, and she fails to evoke any real intimidation. The role demands theatrical flair, but Gadot seems completely out of her depth, making it hard to take her seriously as a threat. What should have been a highlight of the film ends up being its most embarrassing misstep.

Given its staggering $270 million budget, Snow White (2025) was expected to be a massive hit. Instead, it crashed and burned, barely scraping $100 million globally. Critics and audiences alike have slammed the film, with many pointing to Gadot’s lackluster performance as a key issue. Disney’s attempt at modernization only resulted in stripping the film of any soul or entertainment value.

If there’s one lesson to be learned from Snow White (2025), it’s that casting an A-list star doesn’t guarantee success. Gal Gadot’s wooden, uninspired performance drags down an already lifeless film, making it one of Disney’s worst remakes to date. This was supposed to be a tale of beauty and envy, but the only thing ugly here is the film itself.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Zegler’s comments about the original Snow White being a ""stalker"" and the Prince ""creepy"" would’ve been fine if the remake actually offered something better—but no! Instead, we get a bland, corporate-approved ""girlboss"" version that strips away all the charm of the original while failing to replace it with anything meaningful. And let’s not forget the *hilarious* irony of Zegler mocking the original’s love story, only for this new film to reportedly *keep* the problematic kiss because test audiences got confused without it.  

The whole production reeks of Disney scrambling to please everyone and ending up with a movie that pleases *no one*—too ""woke"" for traditionalists, too hollow and pandering for progressives, and too ugly (seriously, the leaked set photos looked like a high-school play) for anyone with functioning eyes. This isn’t a reimagining; it’s a trainwreck. Congrats, Disney—you took something timeless and turned it into a meme.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

The soundtrack is a cacophony of auto-tuned woodland creatures that'll make you wish you could bite into a poisoned apple yourself just to escape the auditory torture. And don't even get me started on the ""modern twist"" they tried to put on the story. Spoiler alert: Snow White becoming a crypto-mining influencer while the prince runs a fair-trade dwarf labor union is NOT the progressive take they thought it was.

The acting is so wooden, I'm pretty sure they just carved the cast out of the same tree they used for Snow White's coffin. The only redeeming quality of this dumpster fire is that it's so bad, it might actually put you into a deep sleep until the next terrible remake comes along.

Save your money, save your time, and for the love of all that is holy, save your sanity. This movie is the real poison apple of 2025's film offerings. Disney should be ashamed for unleashing this curse upon humanity. I'd give it negative stars if I could.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

When she ate the apple and went to sleep, this was the first time I felt sad and an emotional weight to Snow White being bespelled. My issues are with the opening act, the evil queen, dwarves, and bandits. The opening musical number was long and not sure if it was all needed. Gal Gadot was a fun evil queen, but her musical number was bad: the song itself and Gadot's singing did not make for an amazing number or villain song. The dwarves characters, scenes, and personalities were fun, but the fact they were cgi is what made them unappealing. Last, the bandit characters just faded in the background and could have had more charm or humor and character.

I watched the 2025 Snow White remake on Disney+ last month. This is a tough one to review, because it had so much potential to be a magical new take on a classic. The high point of the entire movie, by far, was the ""Whistle While You Work"" sequence. It was vibrant, energetic, and felt like a true homage to the original. The CGI for the dwarves was also surprisingly well-executed, giving them a unique look and feel that was a highlight of the film.

Let me be clear: Rachel Zegler was well-cast for the role of Snow White. Her voice is absolutely beautiful, and she has a captivating, classic Disney-princess-like quality to her performance that makes you want to root for her. Her musical numbers were strong, and she was the one glimmer of hope in an otherwise dreary production. In a better film, she would have been a triumph, especially considering she had to endure so much hate and racism online for her casting as a Latina actress in the role. She handled it all with grace and still delivered a strong vocal performance.

Unfortunately, those two elements are pretty much the only things that worked. The rest of the movie felt like a rushed and poorly conceived mess. The story deviated from the classic in ways that made little to no sense, and the production quality felt surprisingly cheap. While the sets were satisfactory, they lacked a certain magic and felt flat, adding to the feeling of a film that was lacking in creative vision. Many of the effects looked like they were from a different era of filmmaking—and not in a good way. The acting felt wooden and uninspired, as if the cast wasn't quite sure what movie they were in.

Then there is Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. Her performance was a complete misfire. She waffled between trying to be campy and trying to be menacing, and she failed to do either convincingly. Her on-screen presence was surprisingly weak. The worst part, though, was her singing. Her voice is simply not suited for this kind of a role (or any singing at all for that matter, she CANNOT SING), and it's shockingly apparent. The new song, ""All is Fair,"" is a truly terrible, plodding, and completely unnecessary addition that halts the film's already sluggish momentum. It is, without a doubt, the worst Disney villain song ever written, a truly jarring piece of music that highlights just how poorly conceived this entire production was.

The whole movie also has a strange, detached feel to it, as if the actors recorded their lines in a sound booth and then the scenes were built around the dialogue. It lacked the natural, flowing feel of an American live-action film, and it made the entire experience feel stilted and unnatural. Ultimately, what could have been a beautiful reimagining felt like a clumsy misstep that needed a complete overhaul in almost every department.

I walked into this movie knowing it was going to be bad, and somehow it still performed lower than my expectations, it was actually funny to see! It's not as bad as everybody says it is, but it's definitely nowhere near good. 1/5 stars for me, Disney. Sorry.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Every single decision feels like a deliberate slap in the face to the original fans, as if the creators despised the very essence of Snow White and went out of their way to destroy it.

The writing is atrocious, filled with uninspired, hollow messaging that adds nothing of value to the narrative. It’s not just woke—it’s aggressively so, without any substance to justify the changes. It doesn’t feel like a meaningful update or a fresh take; it feels like a cheap, hollow cash grab that exists solely to pander, with no real artistic merit. The singing? Passable at best, but completely unnecessary and devoid of the magic that made Disney musicals legendary. Instead of enhancing the story, it drags the already miserable experience even further down.

Visually, the film is bland, lifeless, and utterly uninspired. The characters are forgettable, the charm of the original is non-existent, and the pacing is a mess. Watching this abomination feels like being force-fed an ideology rather than enjoying an actual story. There’s no heart, no soul—just a cynical, corporate-approved travesty that spits on everything the original represented.

Let’s just start with the good news: the movie is over. 
Disney’s latest live-action swing at Snow White tries to serve us modern empowerment, progressive values, and updated visuals—but what we got feels more like someone left the original fairy tale in a microwave too long and then tried to pass it off as gourmet.

Snow White, But Hold the Snow, White, Dwarfs, Prince… and Joy
Remember that whimsical fairytale you loved? Yeah, it got put in the Witness Protection Program. This Snow White isn’t dreaming of love—she’s dreaming of becoming a leader, which is great… except no one bothered to tell the story that gets her there. She’s less “fairest of them all” and more “vaguely annoyed with everything.” And honestly? Same.

The prince? Gone. Romantic subplot? Yeeted. The magic mirror should’ve just said, “Sis, you're in the wrong genre.”

The Script: Now With 80% More Buzzwords!
The dialogue is like watching a TED Talk that doesn’t end. Instead of letting the themes come alive through action and growth, the characters just tell you what the movie stands for—loudly and often. It’s like a motivational poster came to life and forgot to be entertaining.

 The Evil Queen… or Evil Meh
Usually, Disney villains steal the show. Here? The Evil Queen is serving looks but no menace. She’s got the evil wardrobe, the stare, the lair—but absolutely none of the spice. She's like a villain who's also your passive-aggressive boss: petty, but not memorable.

CGI Forest, Population: Confused Audience
The visual effects feel like someone downloaded the ""Generic Fantasy Land"" pack and hit autoplay. At one point, it was hard to tell if Snow White was running from danger or just trying to escape the rendering delay.

Good Intentions, Murky Execution
Now to be fair—Disney did try. The intent to create a more inclusive and empowered version of the tale is clear. But in trying so hard not to be the original, it became something else entirely: a fairytale with no real heart, no stakes, and no fun.

If you came for nostalgia, you’ll leave confused. If you came for a fresh take, you’ll leave wondering if you accidentally walked into a satire. The movie isn’t offensively bad—it’s just aggressively mediocre, which might be worse.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

### **Dreary Visuals & Lifeless World-Building**  
From the very first frame, the cinematography is bland and uninspired. The forests feel artificial, the castles lack grandeur, and the magical creatures are so poorly rendered that they pull you out of the story. The overuse of lackluster CGI makes the film feel more like a video game cutscene than a cinematic experience.  

### **A Weak and Unrelatable Snow White**  
Snow White's portrayal in this version lacks depth and charm. The character feels more like a poorly written archetype than a real person. Her lack of emotional resonance and unconvincing journey make it impossible to root for her, leaving audiences disconnected and indifferent.  

### **Unfocused and Dragging Storytelling**  
The storytelling is a mess, with pacing that swings wildly between rushed and unbearably slow. The plot introduces unnecessary subplots that add nothing to the narrative, while key emotional moments are glossed over, making the entire film feel disjointed and tiresome.  

### **Miscast Actors & Forgettable Performances**  
The casting choices are baffling, and the performances are lackluster at best. The chemistry between the characters is nonexistent, and most of the dialogue feels wooden and forced. Even the seven companions, who are supposed to bring charm and humor, come across as annoying and irrelevant.  

### **Clichéd Themes & Forgettable Message**  
The film attempts to deliver an empowering message, but it’s buried under a pile of clichés and uninspired dialogue. Instead of feeling fresh or meaningful, the themes come across as preachy and hollow, leaving no lasting impact.  

---

### **Final Verdict**  
*""Snow White 2025"" is a film to avoid, whether you’re a fan of the classic or simply looking for a good movie. It strips away the charm and magic of the original, replacing it with dull visuals, lifeless performances, and an incoherent story. Save your time and money—this is one reimagining that should have stayed on the drawing board.*","You and 181 other people found this helpful.","181 people found this helpful."

I let the movie roll in the background and couldn't even finish 1/2 of it.

When the dwarfs appeared, my 3 year old son asked me to turn off the tv. OMG, those 7 dwarfs are creepy. He was able to watch the original Snow White and even laughed at Doopey's during the funny bubble hiccups.

Sorry, but the show was sloppy, I gave 2 stars as i think i manage to watch half of it. But i think the script writers, directors or whoever allowed this couldn't even find any moments in snow white right. For every Disney moment there are pinnacle of wonders; like Cinderella with the dress (i awed in cinema at that moment she transformed), Beauty and the Beast (the dance hall) or Aladdin with the prince entrance moment(the song was just perfect) or Lion King's pride rock(wasn't amazing but it is still right). For snow white, what CAN'T go wrong went wrong...from the very first moment she was named, the Disney magic disappeared. That was the moment - the very moment that amazes me as kid that Snow White is fair and white as snow and this show took that away from me.

The Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot, is about as menacing as a cardboard cutout. She's super pretty and all, but it’s like she’s playing dress-up in a villain costume. Zero real evil energy. I've seen cosplayers play the part better and they dont even have actress training or whatever. And don’t even get me started on the dwarfs—why did they use CGI for them? It’s 2025, why didn't they hire people with dwarfism? It's really not that hard, Disney claims to be so inclusive but avoids the real issues.

The songs? Meh. They tried to make the music more “hip” but ended up with a bunch of forgettable tracks that don't even compare to the OG tunes.

In short, Snow White 2025 is pretty to look at, but that's about it. If you're into watching a classic get over-complicated and turning your brain completely off, this one's for you.

From start to finish, the film feels like a lifeless, confused mess that tries so hard to be modern and ""different"" that it completely forgets what made the original so beloved. The story’s heart is gone replaced with clunky dialogue, heavy-handed messaging, and a main character who’s written with such forced empowerment that she becomes unrelatable. Rachel Zegler clearly has talent, but her Snow White feels cold and distant, more like a lecture than a character you can root for. The removal and replacement of the dwarfs comes off more as a PR move than a creative decision, and it strips the film of the charm and whimsy those characters brought to the original. Visually, it’s surprisingly dull—flat CGI, awkward editing, and a color palette that makes everything look washed out and dreary. Even the songs, which should have been a saving grace, are forgettable at best and cringey at worst. It’s like the film was made by a committee more interested in checking boxes than telling a good story. In the end, this remake feels less like a tribute and more like a corporate product that’s been rebranded to appeal to everyone and ends up resonating with no one.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

There was nothing wrong with the original version if your going to turn anything into a live action keep it as true to the original instead of adding bits that shouldn't be in a moving. Singing was good. Animals and dwarfs were hilarious but the lead actress does not look anything like a disney princess. And the iconic dress isn't worn until the huntsman takes her into the forest. They changed the meaning behind her name from her skin being as white as snow to she was born during a snow blizzard. The magic mirror doesn't even say his description of Snow White. I absolutely loved the original but I'm completely disappointed with Disney for ruining a classic fairy tale story and unfortunately let politics into the movie and between the lead actress's. The death scene of the queen is totally wrong but I wish I had a self repairing mirror the cliff scene has gone. Heigh ho has been turned into a musical number rather than a jingle. And the parts where snow white is angry in this movie when ever she in the same scene it's not acting anger coming from rachel it seriously looks like she wants to kill Gal. Walt Disney will be turn in his grave at what they have done to this. It didn't get good until the dwarfs were involved and as for the animals I loved them. But if you just focus on the story line and the leading actress it's awful as they have just ruined the memory of the original even with rachel discrediting the the 1937 movie saying its dated and the Prince is a stalker and that she was scared of it when she was a kid and even the ride of snow white in walt disney world that scare her as a kid. I went on it when I was six the movie didn't scare me or anything. She's taken the whole thing out of proportion. No wonder that the majority of seats in a showing are empty. It's nothing that disney hyped about. Let's hope they keep to the story in lilo and stitch live action. Walt Disney wanted all animation to be made into live action i don't think that included changing the entire film. 

I wanted to watch it because I love snow white but left the theatre feeling disappointed. You've lost billions due to bad publicity, the bad acting, not actually getting dwarfs to play said dwarfs and not have the big premieres to get people interested in the movie it's just been swept under the carpet and then it's out. 

Really not worth getting hyped up about it you'll be left disappointed by it all.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

I had high hopes for the new *Snow White* movie, especially with all the buzz surrounding it, but sadly, it falls short in nearly every aspect. From the plot to the performances, it feels like a missed opportunity to bring something fresh to the classic tale.

First, the pacing is painfully slow. What should be an enchanting journey through Snow White’s world feels more like a dragged-out sequence of unimportant scenes. The script is lackluster, with awkward dialogue that doesn’t match the magic and charm the story is known for. At times, it almost feels like it’s trying too hard to be modern and relevant, but instead comes off as forced and out of place.

As for the cast, the performances are flat. While Snow White herself has a few good moments, overall, her character is more of a passive observer than an active protagonist. There’s little emotional depth to her journey, and you never truly feel connected to her struggles. The dwarfs, who were once beloved characters, feel underdeveloped and their interactions seem forced, lacking the humor and warmth we expected.

The visuals, which should be one of the film's strongest points, also fail to impress. The CGI effects feel heavy-handed and sometimes distract from the charm of the original animated version. The sets and costumes seem out of place, too, failing to capture the timeless fairy-tale aesthetic and instead feeling overly artificial.

Finally, the film tries to tackle some modern social issues, but it does so in such an obvious, clumsy way that it feels more like a lecture than a story. The messaging gets in the way of the film’s overall tone and distracts from the emotional journey that should be unfolding.

Overall, this *Snow White* adaptation is a disappointment. It doesn’t live up to the magic of the original nor does it offer anything new or interesting. For fans of the classic story, this movie is a letdown and a missed opportunity to reinvent an iconic tale. Save your time and revisit the original instead.","You and 10 other people found this helpful.","10 people found this helpful."

      This film, like many of late, seems to try and ""change the standard,"" if you follow, however in the end it seems inorganic and utterly... cringe.

Snow White (2025), the latest live-action remake from Disney, offers a version of the beloved fairy tale that leaves much to be desired. Unfortunately, this new take fails to capture the magic of the original, delivering a film that not only disappoints in terms of storytelling but also in the portrayal of its iconic characters. One of the most significant drawbacks of the movie lies in the casting of Rachel Zegler as Snow White.

While Zegler is a talented actress, her portrayal of Snow White felt disjointed from the character we all know and love. Throughout the film, there seems to be a lack of genuine connection to the source material, as if the very essence of Snow White has been altered for the sake of modern political and social agendas. It’s clear that the actress herself holds a complicated stance on the movie and its message. Zegler has openly expressed discomfort with the traditional Snow White character, and this sentiment unfortunately seeps into her performance, leaving the audience with a version of Snow White that feels distant and unrecognizable.

This disconnect is especially noticeable in how the film injects contemporary ""woke"" ideologies into a timeless tale. The introduction of these elements feels forced, and rather than enhancing the story, they detract from the heart of the original narrative. The story of Snow White, a tale about innocence, kindness, and the triumph of good over evil, is now bogged down by themes that feel completely out of place. The spirit of the original film, which enchanted audiences for generations, is lost in a sea of forced political correctness that seems to be more concerned with appeasing modern sensibilities than honoring the legacy of the fairy tale.

To Rachel Zegler, while your dedication to promoting progressive ideals is admirable in many respects, it’s important to understand that some stories—especially those with such rich cultural and historical significance—are best left unaltered in such dramatic ways. The charm of Snow White has always been in her purity, vulnerability, and growth throughout the story, not in how she reflects today's ideologies. A timeless fairy tale should transcend politics and preserve the universal themes of love, hope, and redemption that resonate with audiences of all ages.

This film, unfortunately, doesn't do justice to that legacy. While I respect your work as an artist, it’s clear that this version of Snow White strays too far from its roots, and in doing so, misses the mark entirely. The movie could have embraced the spirit of the original, while introducing new ideas in a more balanced and respectful manner. Instead, it feels like an attempt to reshape a beloved classic in a way that ultimately harms the very magic that made it special.

In conclusion, Snow White (2025) is a film that struggles to capture the timeless beauty of the fairy tale, and much of that can be traced to its misguided approach to character and message. Rachel, I sincerely hope that future projects allow you to embrace your talents in roles that align more closely with your strengths, and I hope that the industry recognizes that sometimes, honoring the past is just as important as pushing forward with new ideas.

I hope this explains why I rate this movie 1 star","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Whistle While You Work is my favorite scene. I also really loved the Prince's song. Princess problems haha! He was quite charming and he did save her—more than once.
This is a princess role model for our girls of today. She is feminine and strong, someone who cares for others before herself, and someone who wishes to be strong to save her kingdom from the evil queen who is starving the people and turning them against each other. i really hated the queen!
I wish I could watch it again, but I'll have to wait until it streams. I predict parents will break down and watch this with their kids and they're going to be so happy they did and I hope feel a little regret for not taking them to watch it on the big screen.

Rather than honoring the 1937 animated masterpiece, the film takes unnecessary creative liberties that ultimately weaken the story and characters.

One of the biggest issues is the characterization of Snow White herself. Instead of the kind, gentle princess who won audiences’ hearts, this version of Snow White feels unrecognizable, with changes that seem more focused on making a statement than telling a compelling fairy tale. The decision to remove or drastically alter the seven dwarfs further disconnects the film from its roots, making it feel generic rather than nostalgic.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some of the cinematography and CGI are impressive, there are moments where the effects look artificial, and the whimsical atmosphere of the original is replaced with a dull, uninspired aesthetic. The music, which should have been a highlight, fails to leave an impact, with forgettable renditions of classic songs and lackluster new additions.

Perhaps the most frustrating aspect is how Disney seems embarrassed by its own legacy, making changes that undermine what made Snow White endure for generations. Instead of a timeless fairy tale, we’re left with a lifeless adaptation that lacks the magic, warmth, and wonder of the original. Fans of classic Disney will likely walk away disappointed, wondering why this remake needed to exist at all.

The seven dwarfs in Ai were great and fun! ( as so would using real dwarfs would have been ) 

The random group of forest people in different shapes colours and sizes was the strangest thing I’d ever seen and didn’t match the original storyline it was just plain odd and gave the movie a very low budget feel.

Where’s Prince Charming ?? Johnathan ( replacing the Prince ) was absolutely ridiculous. Himself as an actor was fine but he didn’t look like a Disney prince and he looked twice her age which was just strange. 

Little kids want to see Disney as Disney! A fairytale wonder, a magical escape, it’s not supposed to be woke and political it’s a disney movie! 

It’s like swapping ET for Mike Wazowski. Just didn’t work.

Create a new movie with all those things. But don’t change what is already so perfect for what it is and supposed to be and ruin a wonderful original picture.

Rachel Zegler's snowhite clearly has Femnist narcissistic issues. Invited herself to the Dwarfs house and just bullies them into tidying up. Not a good example to the young children watching. Not to mention she didn't match the character description which was why she was called snowhite in the first place. Snowwhite actually smiles not frowning constantly. 

Let's talk about the elephant in the room. Dwarves we're going to be replaced by ""special people"" that already upset a lot of people it upset the actual real Dwarf community. (they prefer to be called this and not the politically correct term ""small people"") 
so they amended things... With cgi Dwarves....At this rate they may aswell have made it all animation as it looked extremely fake. Not only that but 7 real Dwarves didn't get to play the role. 

Nothing beats going to a cinema and having real life angry dwarfs protesting against the movie. Well done Disney.","You and 230 other people found this helpful.","230 people found this helpful."

Rachel Zegler, while talented, doesn’t quite capture the essence of Snow White. The role called for someone who embodies the classic fairy tale princess in both looks and demeanor, and unfortunately, the casting choice didn’t fully deliver.

On the technical side, the visual effects are stunning—the magic mirror, the enchanted forest, and the Queen’s transformations are all top-notch. However, one major letdown is the decision to use CGI for the dwarves instead of casting actual actors. This takes away some of the charm and authenticity that made the original so beloved.

Overall, while Snow White (2025) has some impressive visuals, Disney’s attempt at a modern twist feels more like a checkbox exercise than a meaningful update to the classic story.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

Instead, we get a revisionist take that strips away everything that made the story special. The iconic dwarfs have been replaced with CGI abominations, rather than casting real actors who could have brought charm and authenticity to the roles. The acting is wooden at best, with the lead actress delivering an uninspired, lifeless performance that lacks any of the innocence or warmth of the original Snow White.

The film sacrifices heart and good storytelling in favor of modern political messaging, which feels forced and out of place in a fairy tale. The essence of the story—about kindness, love, and overcoming adversity—has been abandoned in favor of a narrative that seems more concerned with checking ideological boxes than entertaining audiences.

Overall, this Snow White remake is a disgrace to the original, a soulless cash grab that alienates fans while failing to attract new audiences. It’s another example of Disney prioritizing “modernization” over respecting the classics, and the result is an unwatchable train wreck.","You and 7 other people found this helpful.","7 people found this helpful."

It wasn't a musical at all and it's a great movie. 

 2. 7 Dwarves: 
There are many people that have dwarfism that would of played an excellent roll in the film, plus great paying jobs for 7 men. 
You really should have did a casting roll for people that could have played the 7 dwarfs.


 Basically: 
The storyline was great and so was the acting. But the musical parts were very annoying, plus no real people playing the parts as the 7 dwarfs, basically ruined that could of been a great movie spot. 

I would have gave it a 5 star rating if it didn't have the musical and it actually used people that have dwarfism. 
I'm only giving it a 3 star rating because of the storyline and the acting was pretty good.

Cons:
1. The CGI is pretty abhorrent. They went with this sort of stylized realism that almost falls into the uncanny valley. It would have been much better if they went for full on realism, especially with the animals. 
2. Gal Gadots performance and singing was disappointing/hard to watch at times. (She only has one song I think tho I missed like the first 10 minutes of the movie)

The Evil Queen couldn’t sing to save her life, which made her scenes even more unbearable.

The only likable characters were Jonathan and the adorable woodland creatures. They were the only ones who brought any charm to this mess. I honestly wanted to walk out of the theater, and even the kids in the audience were clearly bored and confused by what was happening a long with my husband falling asleep half way through the film.

It’s also laughable how much Rachel Zegler emphasized that this isn’t a love story and that Snow White isn’t saved by a prince—yet, in the movie, he literally takes an arrow to the shoulder to save her. So yes, she technically does get saved by a man, and yes, there is a love story, no matter how much Rachel zegler was trying to deny it.

What should have been a nostalgic reimagining of a fairy tale for new generations has instead become an example of how far Hollywood is willing to go to push a ""woke"" agenda, often at the expense of the story itself.

First and foremost, the movie’s biggest flaw is how it attempts to rewrite the original story to fit modern political sensibilities. The decision to cast a mixed-ethnicity actress in the lead role might have been well-intentioned in terms of representation, but it feels more like a marketing decision than one based on bringing Snow White to life. The character of Snow White was never about race, yet the film feels the need to make the character’s background a central part of her identity, without adding much depth to her as a character.

Then there’s the introduction of overly political themes that detract from the fairy tale magic. The movie tries to cram in ideas and discussions that don’t belong in a fantasy world, focusing more on social issues than the adventure, romance, and whimsy that made the original film so memorable. While it’s important to address social issues, forcing them into a classic fairy tale feels like an agenda more than creative storytelling.

Perhaps the most baffling decision was the removal of the term ""dwarfs."" Disney’s 2025 remake replaces the iconic seven dwarfs with a group of ""magical creatures"" to avoid offending anyone. The original term ""dwarf"" was never meant to be derogatory but rather part of the whimsical nature of the story. The decision to erase this term comes off as pandering, trying too hard to avoid backlash while stripping away the unique charm that made the dwarfs so beloved in the first place. Instead of embracing the fantasy of the original, the film chooses to play it safe, catering to modern sensibilities without understanding the essence of the characters.

Overall, this remake of Snow White feels more like a statement than a film. Disney’s attempt to modernize and politicize a classic has resulted in a lackluster, forced story that fails to capture the magic of the original. Instead of a timeless tale, we’re left with a movie that feels disjointed, overly preachy, and ultimately forgettable. It's a sad day when a classic fairy tale is stripped of its magic in the name of political correctness.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

I love the way the romance between Snow White and her love interest (who cares if he's not a prince??) was crafted more realistically. 

It also did not stray too far from the original?? I mean I get that the original Snow White has a more gentle voice and whatever, but the MUSIC in this reimagining was SO GOOD. The soundtrack was a real highlight for me, I think FIRST AND FOREMOST, THIS MOVIE IS A MUSICAL. 

Rachel Zegler's acting was also sooo good. I'm not a fan of hers and this is my first movie she's in, but her performance pulled me into the movie. The CGI is also not horrible- everyone hating needs to stop acting like they're CGI experts. There's a few wonky scenes but I get it. 

Also for the people trashing the costume/makeup and how they didn't do Rachel Zegler justice, THEY DO. You just haven't watched the movie yet. There's supposed to be a symbolic progression, and online people share the same misleading clips (and also consider the fact that the Evil Queen WANTS Snow White to be ugly). 

Snow White was actually a beautiful movie. I bet half of you reviewers haven't even watched it.

It's not even because it's ""woke"" or whatever. It's literally just Snow White, but more interesting to watch for modern audiences. (Who cares if Rachel Zegler doesn't have snow white skin?? The movie creatively adds more powerful meaning to her name).

The latest adaptation of *Snow White* by Disney has proven to be an immense disappointment, far removed from the timeless magic of the original. As a long-time fan, it’s disheartening to witness such a cherished story reshaped into something unrecognizable. Gone are the iconic songs and the charm of Prince Charming himself—both integral elements that gave the original its heart and soul.

Even before production began, this film's reputation was already marred, largely due to the divisive remarks and approach taken by those involved. Rachel Zegler’s portrayal feels disconnected from the spirit of the character, alienating many loyal fans who hoped for a respectful update rather than an overhaul.

To make matters worse, the film seems less about storytelling and more about prescribing a moral directive, which feels heavy-handed and detracts from the joy of the narrative. Disney, once a beacon of enchantment and creativity, appears to have abandoned its heritage in favor of what it calls a ""progressive"" stance—sadly at the expense of the elegance and artistry that built its legacy.

This adaptation is a glaring misstep that reflects a lack of understanding and respect for the original material. It leaves audiences longing for the charm and enchantment that Disney once mastered effortlessly.

It stripped away everything charming and heartfelt about the original.

I understand and fully support the importance of adding diversity and representation in modern films—especially for children. That’s something I believe in. But this movie used that effort as a cover to completely rewrite the story in a way that made no sense and had no heart. It felt like they were trying to make a statement rather than tell a meaningful story.

The classic songs we loved? Gone. Instead, we got new songs that were dull, forgettable, and added nothing to the experience. The entire plot was rewritten for no good reason. There was no prince—just some random guy with no real purpose. And the rebels, with their outdated 90s grunge costumes, felt like something pulled out of a Descendants movie, not a timeless Disney fairytale. 

The added songs were unnecessary, the characters lacked chemistry, and worst of all—the set design looked incredibly fake. It didn’t feel magical or immersive; it looked cheap. The entire production felt rushed and shallow. The actor playing the rebel leader was just not right for the role either, in terms of acting or presence.

I’ve never walked away from a Disney movie feeling this disappointed. It was nothing like the classic, and frankly, it was hard to sit through. I won’t be watching it again, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone looking for the wonder and joy of the original. This movie was a complete letdown—one of the worst live-action adaptations Disney has ever done.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

They were forced no take that back all of the villagers are super omega dumb they all had the free will to leave even if they were forced to stay who’s stopping them? The evil lady I forgot her name cause I was so uninvested had the lamest powers she used them like 5 times so I doubt she could force everyone to stay. Like they all came marching to the kingdoms door with Snow White which by the way looked like Lord Farquhar by the end of the movie. But they all went with her to the castle to protest why didn’t they all get up and leave together what was keeping them there clearly nothing cause the evil Queen wasn’t even feeding them why didn’t they just all go to another kingdom or make a new one who’s stoping them the guards? The guards were literally family members they were so gullible they would’ve left with them. Stupidest story telling it would’ve been much cooler if the evil lady made herself a scary much more threatening army using her witch powers but no that’s not in the budget.

All the characters were bland and shallow and didn't experience any type of character development (except Dopey, which he talked out of nowhere at the end of the movie, but it seemed like he copied the villager in the Minecraft movie). Rachel Zegler is a good singer, but they did her dirty with that ugly bob cut and intolerable personality; she wasn't a good choice as Snow White. 

The plot was also really weak, it was Snow White, but with pointless lore and weird relationships. And I don't know what Rachel was talking about, the ""prince"" did save her self-absorbed behind.

The newly written songs were super out of place and forgettable, when the movie is intended to be more fairytale-fantasy and true to the original story. As a matter of fact, everything about this movie is too modern and out of place to the animated version of Snow White.

Don't know why I had to watch this, I was better off staying curious because half the time I wanted to leave the theater and watch the Minecraft movie again.

Overall, I feel sorry to the people who had to work on this, and I hope they get a raise for dealing with these controversial celebrities and Disney executives.

First off, Snow White herself? Bland as soggy bread. They turned her into some ""strong independent woman"" stereotype, but forgot to actually give her a personality. She just monologues about how she don’t need no prince, but somehow manages to be the least interesting person in her own movie. Meanwhile, the Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot, was supposed to be scary, but all I saw was a high-budget shampoo commercial.

And don’t get me started on the visuals. Disney flexed their budget like, ""Look, we got CGI dwarfs!""—but man, those things were nightmare fuel. They didn’t even look like characters; they looked like PlayStation 2 cutscene rejects. And the ""enchanted forest""? More like ""green-screen disaster with AI-generated trees.""

The music? Forgettable. The humor? Forced. The magic? Completely MIA. Bro, I swear, this movie had all the soul of a corporate PowerPoint presentation. Even the poisoned apple looked like it wanted out.

Final thoughts? Disney took a classic and ran it through the world's most boring ""woke"" filter, removing everything that made it fun.

Unfortunately, what I got instead was a hollow, uninspired film that disrespects its own source material while trying too hard to be “modern.”
Let’s be clear, diversity in film is a great thing. The problem isn’t inclusion; the problem is forcing it into a story where it doesn’t naturally fit, instead of creating new narratives that celebrate diversity in an authentic way. Disney could have introduced an original fairytale inspired by different cultures, but instead, they chose to rewrite Snow White into something that barely resembles the original.

The heart of Snow White (a fairytale) about kindness, innocence, and fantasy was completely lost. The filmmakers removed the romance aspect and changed the Seven Dwarfs into a random group of characters, which felt like an unnecessary attempt at being “progressive.” Instead of enhancing the story, these changes made it feel directionless, as if the film was more concerned with making a statement than telling a compelling tale.
Rachel Zegler’s portrayal of Snow White also lacked the warmth and charm that made the original character so timeless. Her comments in interviews about how the original film was outdated only added to the frustration, if you don’t respect the story you’re remaking, why even bother?
Disney had the opportunity to celebrate diversity by creating a fresh, original fairytale with a multicultural cast. Instead, they took a well-loved classic, stripped it of its essence, and tried to pass it off as something empowering. In reality, it just felt like an uninspired attempt at modernizing something that didn’t need fixing.
If Disney really wants to champion diversity, they should invest in new stories instead of backtracking on originals and calling it progress.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Disney’s latest adaptation of Snow White takes a bold departure from the classic 1937 animated film, but not necessarily for the better. While visually stunning, the movie lacks the heart and emotional depth that made the original a timeless tale of love, innocence, and personal growth.

Rather than centering on the classic love story, this version shifts its focus to themes of female empowerment and leadership. While strong female leads can be inspiring, the essence of Snow White—a story about kindness, love, and transformation—feels lost in the process. The original film was about a young woman’s journey, where love played a central role. Here, romance is sidelined in favor of modern messaging, making it feel disconnected from the story’s roots.

Another controversial change is the casting. Snow White is traditionally a character known for her “skin as white as snow,” yet the casting decision seems to deliberately move away from that, almost as if to make a statement. While inclusivity in film is important, changing core elements of a beloved character can feel forced rather than organic. If the goal was to create more diversity, perhaps a new fairy tale with its own cultural roots would have been a better approach rather than altering an existing one.

Despite its flaws, the film is undeniably beautiful, with breathtaking visuals and detailed set design. However, beauty alone does not make a film memorable. Unfortunately, the lack of emotional connection and deviation from the classic themes make this adaptation feel more like a political statement than a heartfelt retelling of a beloved fairy tale.

For longtime fans of Snow White, this version may not capture the magic of the original. Those looking for a visually appealing film with modern themes might appreciate it, but if you’re hoping for a faithful and emotionally engaging adaptation, you may walk away disappointed.

Let me just say this: if I wanted to watch a girl sing to dishes and pass out from eating apples, I’d just go to a Pinterest mom’s Instagram reel. This movie is a sleep aid wrapped in glitter.   I had high hopes revisiting Snow White, given its legendary status as the first full-length animated feature. Unfortunately, nostalgia couldn’t save this dated, painfully slow story. The animation is undeniably impressive for its time, but that’s about where the praise ends. The movie drags with a paper-thin plot, one-dimensional characters, and a lead so passive it’s hard to root for her. This is a film that survives on history, not merit.

Snow White herself is disappointingly bland. She spends most of the film either cleaning, singing to animals, or sleeping. There’s no real growth, no conflict she actively overcomes, and she essentially relies on everyone else to save her. The lack of agency is frustrating. Even in a fairytale setting, you’d expect the protagonist to display more personality than just “sweet and obedient.” She feels more like a symbol than a person, which makes it hard to care about her fate.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Young Kids will enjoy it regardless.

Unfortunately as we don't live in that world and Snow White is a remake of the original.  Then Disney completely and utterly missed an amazing opportunity to refresh this classic.  I have to say despite what others have said, and i hate to say but you can certainly tell there is an agenda been pushed here by Disney.  To subtle for young kids to notice.

Disney cast the wrong actress here, not because of her race, but because she didn't embrace or embody the roll and denigrated it publicly.  Why Disney didn't have real dwarf actors is also incredibly short sighted (no pun intended) the animation of the so called Dwarfs is awful, considering the budget, and look as if rushed into the films story.

They also don't really show a definitive gender clearly.  

Because of the non binary poorly animated dwarfs, no real dwarf actors, (considering some of the excellent dwarf actor talent out there which could of brought a new intresting perspectiveto the story). Rachels absolute destruction of the original Snow White, and lack of truth on the originals love story, a woke agenda seems clearly intentionally done here.

Because of this it doesn't get a solid 3 stars but 2,  just.

Some of the 1 Star reviews are clearly a push back at Disney.  

Yes it is atrocious retelling and the wrong actress with the wrong attitude to the story, who should of been fired due to her public criticism and denigration of the original story. but continued in the roll anyway.  Awfully non binary animated Dwarfs - Disney what the actual F were you thinking here.

However 

Gal Gadot, gives a good performance though a bit stiff at times.  Zeglars, feels false when compared with her very public opinion of the Story but has a great voice she sings truly well, but the songs themselves are a bit hit and miss.  Some impressive animation along with some poor considering the huge budget.  Young kids will be non the wiser and will enjoy it.  But as a refresh of a classic story. Disney dropped the ball big time here.

Rachel killed this film which should of been epic.  Disney, why no real Dwarfs? Poor & prejudice decision!  A truly missed opportunity just by this decision alone. Get a new board of Executives!

Parents of young children - Yes they will certainly enjoy this film, take them to see it.  But it's no real Snow White Remake.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Gone are the lighthearted moments, the beloved dwarfs, and Snow White’s traditional storyline. Instead, we get a reimagined Snow White who no longer resembles the gentle, kind character we knew, but is instead transformed into yet another “strong, independent” protagonist seemingly designed to check boxes rather than tell a compelling story.

Art and storytelling should evolve, but not at the cost of erasing what made these classics special in the first place. Sometimes, the magic is in letting a fairy tale be a fairy tale, without bending it to fit modern political narratives.

If you’re looking for the enchanting story of Snow White, I’d recommend revisiting the original – this version has little in common with it, and unfortunately, it shows.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

First off, the visuals are just bad. The sets look fake, the CGI is obvious, and the so-called “dwarfs” are just weirdly animated stand-ins. It’s like they couldn’t decide if they wanted to go realistic or stylized, so they ended up with something that looks straight out of a cheap video game.

Then there’s the script. The heart of Snow White is supposed to be, well, Snow White. But this version of her is completely unrecognizable. Instead of a kind and gentle character, she’s given generic “girlboss” dialogue that feels forced and out of place. And don’t even get me started on the lack of chemistry between any of the characters—everyone seems like they’re just reading lines without actually believing in what they’re saying.

Rachel Zegler’s performance doesn’t help either. After all the controversy surrounding her comments about the original movie, it’s hard to separate that from the film itself. And unfortunately, she doesn’t bring much charm to the role. Even Gal Gadot, who should’ve been an amazing Evil Queen, just kind of… exists. It’s like she knew this movie wasn’t worth the effort.

Disney keeps trying to remake classics, but instead of capturing the magic, they just strip away everything people actually love about them. Snow White didn’t need a remake, and after watching this, I kind of wish they had just left it alone.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Unfortunately, this adaptation feels less like a tribute to the beloved story and more like a drastic rewrite with little regard for the spirit or message of the original.

The most jarring departure is the reimagining of Snow White herself. In the original Brothers Grimm story—and Disney’s 1937 animated film—the character is described as having “skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony.” This wasn’t just a physical description; it was symbolic, tied deeply to the story’s fairy-tale identity. Changing such a fundamental trait feels like rewriting the DNA of the character, not out of creative innovation, but to serve modern identity politics.

It’s important to be honest: if the roles were reversed—if a character traditionally depicted as a person of color were recast as white—there would almost certainly be a louder outcry. So why the double standard? Fair representation matters, but so does respecting source material. There’s a difference between updating a story to include diverse perspectives and rewriting it in ways that disregard the essence of the character.

Aside from casting, the film also makes sweeping changes to the tone and themes. The dwarfs are barely recognizable, the love story is de-emphasized to the point of vanishing, and Snow White’s journey is more about political empowerment than personal growth. While some may find this refreshing, others—especially those who cherish the original—may feel alienated.

Representation in media is absolutely important. But representation that feels forced or agenda-driven, especially when it comes at the cost of faithful storytelling, can backfire. Fans want adaptations that honor the stories they love, not ones that use them as vehicles for unrelated messages.

In the end, this version of Snow White feels like it’s less about telling a good story and more about making a statement. Unfortunately, that statement comes at the expense of the magic, charm, and timelessness that made the original tale endure for generations.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Disney’s live-action remake fever has once again managed to ruin a classic! The remake of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) has arrived 88 years later, only to be a complete mess.

Rachel Zegler – Controversy Queen

First of all, Rachel Zegler herself mocked the original movie (""Weird, weird, weird"")—and now, ironically, that's the perfect way to describe this film!

Story – Woke Overload!

The core story remains the same, but Disney has made unnecessary changes that make no sense:
✅ The Evil Queen is still jealous of Snow White’s beauty, but the climax is rewritten poorly.
❌ The Prince is now a side character, almost like a servant. This completely destroys the fairytale magic.
❌ Snow White becomes Queen at the end. Why? This is just another forced “woke” change, following the same formula as The Little Mermaid and Aladdin.

Gal Gadot – Biggest Disappointment!

💔 As much as we hoped for a good performance, she was a letdown.
🔇 Her singing was pure torture!
👑 She looked visually stunning as the Evil Queen, but lacked the powerful intensity needed for the role.

Songs – Too Many, Too Often!

🔄 Songs appear every 5 minutes, even in serious moments!
📉 Other musicals handle this well, but here it feels forced and unnecessary.
🎵 ""Heigh-Ho"" from the Seven Dwarfs brings nostalgia, but the rest of the songs are forgettable.

CGI – The Only Good Thing!
✔️ The film’s only saving grace is its CGI.
✔️ The fantasy world, animals, and dwarfs’ expressions are well done.
❌ However, even great CGI can’t save a terrible story.
Ending – How Much More Could They Ruin?
❌ In the original, the Evil Queen dies by falling off a cliff. Here, she just dies inside the castle.
❌ And the biggest joke – Snow White is made Queen!
Final Verdict: Disney’s Woke Disaster
If you enjoy torture, go ahead and watch this movie! Disney has destroyed another classic.

Snow White herself was an uninteresting protagonist—gone was the kindness and warmth that made her a beloved character, replaced by a generic, uninspired lead with no depth. The supporting cast? Equally forgettable. The dwarfs barely had personalities, and the villain lacked any real menace or intrigue.

The visuals were another disappointment. For a film that should have been a feast for the eyes, the CGI felt overused and lifeless. Instead of enchanting settings, we got soulless, artificial backdrops that looked like they belonged in a cheap video game cutscene. Even the costumes, which should have at least been a highlight, looked uninspired and lacked any real creativity.

Pacing was another major issue. The movie dragged on unnecessarily in parts where nothing interesting was happening, yet somehow managed to rush through key moments that should have been emotionally impactful. By the time the climax rolled around, I had already checked out.

Overall, Snow White felt like a studio-driven project that lacked heart, creativity, or a reason to exist. It neither honored the original nor brought anything new to the table. A complete disappointment.","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

From the first frame to the last, it’s a cringeworthy, soulless cash grab that massacres everything that made the original beloved. The script is an uninspired disaster, the acting is wooden enough to be used as firewood, and the CGI looks like it was rendered on a PlayStation 2. The lead actress sleepwalks through her role like she’s being held at gunpoint, delivering lines with the enthusiasm of a corpse. The so-called ""modern"" take on the story is nothing but a pretentious, virtue-signaling mess that spits in the face of its own source material.  

And don’t even get me started on the dwarves—oh wait, sorry, the “magical forest people” or whatever the hell they’re called now. This movie bends over backwards trying to be progressive, only to fall flat on its smug, self-righteous face. The humor is nonexistent, the action is laughable, and the emotional depth is as shallow as a puddle in the desert.  

Disney somehow managed to take one of the simplest, most timeless fairy tales and turn it into a bloated, soulless wreck. This isn’t a movie—it’s a war crime against cinema.

Honestly I think most of the costumes look like badly made ones for a secondary school play rather than looking alike to the original film. The script was also heavily deviated from the original film, like why is the prince a bandit now? The movie looks dull and lifeless compared to the original. Like I dislike the new girlboss version of Snow White…

Snow White is white as snow and yet in the movie, they called her Snow White since she survived and was born in a blizzard. So according to that logic if she survived in a dark thunderstorm she would be called “Rain Black” (no insults intended). Also, she never met the evil queen at the beginning of the movie and never actually saw her (excluding the witch who offered the apple transformation). In the movie her father married the evil queen.

What’s also very funny is that the Evil Queen didn’t do anything evil when Snow White insulted her, since she had the title “Fairest of Them All.” It wasn’t until the magic mirror said Snow White gained the new title that the Evil Queen wanted to kill her???

And isn’t the Evil Queen supposed to die from falling off the cliff? In the movie she died after smashing the Magic Mirror and becoming glass herself. And also she dies after Snow White’s supposed death as well…


Finally, about the ending. In the original Snow White kisses the prince and wakes up and they leave together and the story ends there. In the 2025 ending, they have some sort of weird party where everyone dresses in white. Excuse me does that even have a meaning?

So don’t even try watching the 2025 remake. Watch the old one, it’s always there.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

I honestly went in with very high expectations because Rachel Ziegler was in it. I loved her other work in Westside story and the ballad of songbirds and snakes. I thought she would be the next big thing for Disney. She has so much potential. also, Snow White was my Disney movie as a little girl so of course i would expect something close to the sensational original. Oh boy never have i been so…disappointed. The music. The dwarves. The love interest. The queen. They took so many of the original songs out, it broke the little girls heart inside of me those were what made me fall in love with the original thing of course, I completely understand modernizing a new version of a Disney original, but this was just so far it was unenjoyable. I don’t know what those waxy little people were, but they were not the Dwarfs I was expecting. Personally, it would’ve felt so much more special with actual little people doing it. Also, they took The prince out? Okay it was a cool idea to have a thief help our princess fight and eventually grow their relationship into something more than an alliance. They Pretty much followed that concept, but it was so hollow. gal Gadot is a good actress, but completely entirely not who I ever imagined to play the role of the good old evil queen. And her song? don’t get me started. A load of rubbish. The costumes? They looked like someone’s halloween costume. Don’t get me wrong they were beautiful the colors and designs but not what you want for a live action disney movie. look at cinderella and beauty and the beast. Make a realistic enchanting version of it or else it’s gonna be meh.Poltics got so involved as i saw and it ruined so much. This movie is THE rough one for disney and it’ll take a good comeback or comebacks to dim this i don’t want to be too mean but disaster. Also it’s crazy how unhinged rachel zegler became and how she is just MIA right now. Anyways just a small view of my opinion on this film.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Overview:

Snow White:
Tried to make a comforting and pretty feminine character very girlbossy and whatnot. There’s nothing wrong with “confident” characters, but that doesn’t fit Snow White at all. She doesn’t fit the original whatsoever, and if you took away the iconic blue and yellow dress- she’d be unrecognizable compared to the OG.

The storyline was all over the place and had unnecessary amount of “fluff” added to the movie that didn’t need to be there. (Think of it as a lousy essay trying to fill a word count.)

Also, this is just my personal opinion, but the dwarves are cgi which kinda bothers me. Like- dwarf people exist. I thought it’d be cool to see a sort of hobbit-y version of the dwarves.

And Snow White doesn’t even sing by the wishing well and doesn’t want love like, at all. They replaced so many of the iconic moments for legit no reason.

Then, the evil queen- I love Gal Gadot as an actress, but oh my god. The script is sad and grey, none of the songs are memorable and her lines just tone down her overall talent. (This generally goes across every character.) I just felt disappointed.

All in all, I’m pissed off this is what kids will be growing up with. It’s like anything else- forgettable and bland. It’s another way for Disney to make an extra buck without half the effort.

TLDR: bad acting, weird script, cringey jokes, unnecessary fluff and important scenes stripped from the original making it all disappointing.","You and 83 other people found this helpful.","83 people found this helpful."

The CGI throughout the film was badly done, nothing felt 'realistic' and very cartoonish in a live action movie, now I'm not saying that's terrible they've done it with other movies pretty well.. but for how they did it with Snow White it just felt like they green screened everyone into the film with a small amount of props for the actors to use. 

Gal Gadot, could've done really well with the Evil Queen if they had just changed her entire script, different outfit, and overall different story for her. 
She played the part well as she was instructed too, but her outfit looked like it was made of plastic, and looks as if she's just in a jumpsuit with an added dress on it. Her character as the evil queen does not feel like she's evil at all, as the original character was portrayed as. 

Rachel Zegler, disregarding all of the things she said online, the film was very self centered on Snow White being independent. Not needing the help from the dwarves and the 'Prince' (Who isn't even a prince in the movie.) She played the part to the best of her abilities, but I feel they should've had a different actor who could've filled in Snow White's Charm. 

Snow White herself is portrayed as Selfish, and Self-Centered. She has no regards for anyone but herself until the end of the film. Where she and her kingdom storm the castle and 'take down' the evil queen. Where again Snow White is the only one who 'takes her down'. (With her words.)

The Prince, is not even a prince. He's a thief that on occasion runs into Snow White. He's not even in the story enough to get an idea on what type of character he is. 

The only thing original from the story, is Snow White getting kissed and woken up from 'The Prince'. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and recommend you choose another movie for family night.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

SPOILER ALERT: IT IS that bad. Actually, it’s worse. This is officially the worst Disney live-action adaptation ever. (Hooray, Disney, you did it! 🏆)

VISUALS:
- Classic Disney. Predictable but still stunning. The high-res CGI magic is there, and I won’t lie—it’s pretty. But good visuals can’t save a sinking ship right?

STORYLINE:
Ah, where do I even start?

- No flow, no logic, no sense.
- Every scene transition feels like someone hit the “skip” button on Netflix.
- Is like sitting with a 5-year-old watching beside me, & he went, “Eh? How did that happen?” and honestly, same here, kid.

WARDROBE & MAKEUP:
- Rachel’s middle-part hairstyle? NOPE. Just no.
- The only time she actually looked good was when she just came out of the water.
- And that final white dress??? What happened?? Did they run out of ideas, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V the original dress, and throw it into a bleach bucket?? Come on, Disney.

ENDING: (A MASTERCLASS IN DISAPPOINTMENT)
- The military just surrendered??? Bruh.... Seriously?
- The Evil Queen—so powerful, so mighty—but somehow can’t even fight back??? ... And eventually, she gets banished (because literally no one likes her anymore), and then… she just WALKS BACK into the castle like, it’s a 7-Eleven now???
- Then Snow White follows her to see the magic mirror??? Like, girl, WHAT ARE YOU DOING???
- At this point, even a primary school kid could write a better ending. And honestly? I wish they did.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
- Disney, I love you, but what the actual heck was this? You took one of the most legendary princess stories and turned it into a bad school play with high-budget VFX.

Rating: 2/10 (One point for visuals, one point for effort. That’s it.)

The movie didn’t really follow the original Snow White film super closely, but to me that made me enjoy it more. Because while Snow White is THE classic Disney movie, it would pretty boring if it was followed exactly. Ultimately I was surprised in a good way. It surpassed my expectations, which made seeing the movie enjoyable. Everyone does have different tastes and I know a lot of others did not enjoy the movie but from a person who is a tough movie critic, I think the reviews are a little over dramatic. Sure the film wasn’t amazing, but it defiantly wasn’t horrible. If you haven’t seen it, I suggest watching it at least once for the magic, music and nostalgia.

First off, the storyline is a mess. Seriously, how does Disney mess up the storyline? It feels like a bunch of random ideas were just thrown together, and they thought, “Yeah, this is perfect.” It’s frustrating to see such a confusing plot that left me not fully understanding what was going on in the movie.

Now, let’s talk about the CGI, which was another major letdown. The CGI looked weak, especially when it came to the dwarfs. They looked odd and didn’t convey any life or realism. For a movie with a high budget, that’s a huge disappointment.

The acting was also a letdown, which upset me the most. Gal Gadot’s portrayal of the evil witch was excellent, and I enjoyed her performance. However, Rachel Zegler’s acting, while okay, didn’t match the caliber expected from a big-budget movie. Honestly, I think they should’ve swapped roles, as I could see Gal Gadot playing Snow White more convincingly. Overall, the acting felt weak and lacked the spark that I was hoping for.

In conclusion, this movie was a total disappointment. I honestly felt like I wasted both my time and money, expecting it to be good.

Between the short black bob, the smug expression, and the sheer arrogance radiating off her, I half expected her to start yelling, “Some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.” It’s as if Disney saw Shrek and thought, Yes, let’s cast THAT as our princess.

Johnathan is not a prince, he’s a thief and captain of the woodsman which in fact they came back. Why? I guess it was kind of like Robin Hood. Ok? I guess.

So what was NOT good? 
Well, they got away with calling her Snow White because she was born in a blizzard. If that’s how she she got her name. Wouldn’t her parents last name also be named White???
Mostly everything about this movie is boring. The part where she’s looking in the well with her parents to the part were everyone dresses in white, like any Disney live action movie. You can see that in every scene where she walks towards or even the location where they are, no one talks. Until someone begins singing (again)🤦‍♂️.
When she was going to the dwarfs house, she didn’t do anything that was rewarding. She didn’t clean or cook for them, even though those were the things that she did in the palace. It’s always about her and not for someone else. When the dwarfs confront her, she decides to leave in the middle of the night. Why? Hahaha Where can she possibly go in the middle of the night? Hahaha
Also, there is a scene where Snow and Johnathan were singing “A Hand Meets A Hand” were they spoiled the movie by saying “promise to wake me with a kiss” that line doesn’t make any sense unless if this was after Johnathan saved Snow. So, yes. There is true love in the movie, but it wasn’t the main purpose of the movie. Her goal was to become a leader.
When the evil queen transforms herself old, she doesn’t look hideous like in the original movie. She just looks old and her voice is still the same. I was expecting her to have a long nose, warts, less teeth and an elderly voice. Like they did in Enchanted (2007), they would not cut slack on the make up. But this version of Snow White is pretty cheap to do that.
Just seeing Snow White wearing a crown in the ending of book seemed very misleading on what the original story trying to tell us. Also, when Snow White wakes up, Dopey starts talking. I’m sorry, but Dopey doesn’t talk.
So yeah. As you can tell this movie is very WOKE. They pretty much changed a lot of things that made the original Snow White great and special. You might find some good things about the movie, but not any good values towards the original film because they changed it. 
I don’t recommend anybody watching this film, just here to give my thoughts on the movie. Wait till it comes out to Disney+. This movie for sure is gonna flop in theaters. Now if you excuse me. I’m gonna go back to watching the original 1937 film.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

The script? I’ve seen more compelling dialogue in toothpaste commercials. The dwarfs — excuse me, the “mystical woodland companions” — had all the personality of a soggy piece of toast. And Snow White herself? Less “fairest of them all” and more “most likely to be upstaged by a houseplant.”

The special effects looked like they were rendered on a 2008 laptop during a power outage. The forest animals had that haunted CGI stare that says, “I was made by interns and regret everything.”

I would’ve walked out halfway through, but I was stuck between a sleeping toddler and someone who was genuinely enjoying the film, and I didn’t want to ruin their childhood too.

I hope they have lost and continue to lose millions on this. I can’t understand why these big companies cannot figure out that this “culture” is not what America wants. 
Before you go calling me a “bigot” just think of this. Rather than bastardizing a classic story, all the would’ve had to do is create a new one! Like MANY other film companies have done over the years! Why in the WHY would you take a nice little story from the 30’s, and turn it into this trash? There is no other reason than super over correction by a company that has faced a ton of criticism in the past for being “bigoted, racist, anti semite, etc..” This is the only reason this movie was ever even made. Same with the ridiculous remake of The Little Mermaid. Make a new story. If you have that much of an issue with the originals? Then just don’t watch them! 
This was a joke from the beginning- with that Ziegler or whatever, all of her middle finger photos and the totally cringe videos she kept posting, and don’t even get me started on the atrocious singing. Puke.

However, the film’s biggest flaw lies in the controversies surrounding its production.

The decision not only alienated some fans of the original but also frustrated members of the dwarfism community.

While the film itself is enjoyable and well-made, these behind-the-scenes issues distracted from the experience.

Here are some pros and cons about the movie:

Pros: They gave us greater insights on Snow White's backstory and gave us greater details on her parents, and best of all, showed them on screen. They confirmed how they died in this version. They also improved Snow's character from the original, as she turned out to be more than a stereotypical princess waiting for her knight in shining armor to rescue her, as well as Doc, the leader of the seven dwarfs, who turned out to be more intelligent and live up to his name, and the prince (whose name is Jonathan btw), who is less stalkerish and got to know Snow White better by talking to her more, as she does to him and vice versa, and their love story is expanded, as well as Dopey who finally gets to speak and overcome his fears. They also expanded the plot from the original, which was a big improvement for Disney in general.

Cons: They could've expanded on the story a bit more so we could directly see for ourselves as to why Snow White's parents died in the first place, but no, Disney decided to cut that out just for the sake of being as ""family-friendly"" as possible. The acting was too bland, with Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot being the complete opposites of Snow White and the Evil Queen, respectively. I mean, Rachel's acting and singing skills were phenomenal, but her personality was an all time low. Gal Gadot, on the other hand, can act, but she couldn't embody the Evil Queen. They could've hired Gracie Abrams to play Snow White and someone else, like Lady Gaga to play the Evil Queen. Also she can't sing. The script was too thin, in my opinion. They explicitly pointed out details, which is something filmmakers are never supposed to do in the first place. Think about it, if you want to make a good movie, you want to make the audience make inferences based on the context of the script, not directly point it out to them. That's what I would do if I were you. The CGI dwarfs were a mess (no offense to some of the dwarfs I mentioned above), like seriously man, they should've hired real life actors with dwarfism instead of wasting money on useless and pointless stuff like this. I mean, they're not as bad as I thought, but still, they shouldn't have done that.

Overall, I would say I like it, but it's not my favorite. If the movie is bad and you've never watched it, I would suggest you see it for yourself and see if you like it or not. I would give it a 2.5/5.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Honestly hated all the costumes, they looked cheap and like a bunch of extra fabric just thrown together and all around unappealing to look at. I wanted to cut off Jonathan’s hood. And the fact they put it on his white and final outfit was hysterical. Gal Gatot as the evil queen was the one slightly redeeming quality in this absolute train wreck of a movie. How outfits and make-up was great and I was surprised at her singing for the first time on screen. Not a great song lyrically, but she did well vocally.
 And the seven “mythical creatures” who were changed to bandits… yikes. Completely unnecessary and a waste of screen time. Also, really weird to not cast seven little people for the seven most iconic roles for little people… yet they cast an actual dwarf for one of the mythical creature/ bandit characters? Like what the actual f**k. And yes, the CGI is absolute trash. They didn’t do enough for the dwarfs and did too much for the animals. The dwarfs were half done and honestly creepy af and the animals were made overly cute and again kinda creepy.
AND STOP GIVING THE PRINCE A SONG. Eric’s in TLM  and now this one we’re SO BAD my daughter couldn’t even watch it without laughing.

It’s as if the filmmakers took everything that made the original beloved and threw it out the window in favor of a soulless, modernized mess.

The magic and charm of the original 1937 classic are nowhere to be found. Snow White herself is unrecognizable—not just in looks, but in character. She’s been stripped of all warmth, grace, and vulnerability, replaced with a bland, overly “empowered” version that lacks any emotional depth. There’s a big difference between strength and arrogance, and this version doesn’t seem to know it.

And let’s talk about the story. Or rather, the lack of one. Iconic plot points have been awkwardly removed or rewritten to the point where the entire film feels like a different movie loosely borrowing a few names. The dwarfs? Basically erased or replaced without explanation. The Evil Queen is cartoonishly over-the-top without any of the chilling presence that made her terrifying in the original.

The visuals are dull, the pacing is a slog, and the musical numbers—if you can call them that—are forgettable at best, cringe-worthy at worst. It’s clear the focus was on messaging over storytelling, and as a result, it fails on both fronts.

This remake feels less like a tribute and more like an insult to the original. If you loved the classic, do yourself a favor and skip this one. Some stories are timeless for a reason—this version proves what happens when you stop trusting the original magic.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

The evil queen sings, or at least she tries, and it's just terrible, even with all the technology. By the way, Gal Gadot's acting in this movie is at moments laughable. There's no prince, but he's a pauper, a bandit, and he and the prices have a song where they promise to wake each other up with a kiss... So that solves the ""consent"" issue when the time comes. The dwarves CGI is terrible, they simply look bad.
The plot creates many holes by trying to be so modern and correct, that the only way to shove them is with dumb and inefficient statements.

Putting aside all the horrible CGI, some of the scenes do look vibrant and magical. The Dwarfs (who are iconic loveable characters) look creepy and out of place among the live cast. Speaking of the cast, let's move on to them. The only one who was a positive light was the not-a-prince, prince. Who DOES in fact save the princess by taking an arrow for her, and then waking her from the poison apple with a kiss. Making him more of a Robin Hood rebellion leader instead of a prince is an unnecessary, but fine change to the story. That doesn't change the story line too much, but what's wrong with having a prince as a love interest? There was no chemistry between the characters which really made the acting seem more like satire. Rachel has no respect for Snow White and it shows on screen. Snow White is feminine, pure of heart, and finds her inner strength from her kindness and love for others. She does not need to be loud, bold and patronizing, which I think the writers forgot and also shows in the music. It doesn't seem like it was meant for Snow White, but more for Encanto or Wish. Disney needs to remember where their foundation is and raise their standards back up. This is a fairytale meant to inspire with hope and love and show that inner beauty is stronger and more important than outer beauty, this is why she is the fairest of them all, not because she knows how to share apples and cherries. The symbolism of her wishing for love is actually important to show how unloved and mistreated she was living with her step mother. She was hoping and dreaming for compassion and human connection, isn't that something we all can relate to? That doesn't make her a weak character, it makes her a relatable teenager, which she was. That doesn't translate with Rachel's portrayal.

However, given Disney’s recent films… I didn’t want to waste money in theatre’s. Now it’s on Disney+ and figured I’ll give it a try thinking maybe it’s not as bad as the reviews say. I’m aware of review bombing, but wanted to watch before I give my review. This movie is a poisoned apple. The only good, is that the visual elements are stunning—vibrant colors, beautiful costume design, and a solid musical score that at times feels like the classic Disney magic is just within reach. But sadly, that magic never fully arrives.

Instead of a timeless fairy tale, I felt like I was watching a reimagined lecture on modern social agendas. The heart and wonder that once defined Disney storytelling has been replaced with heavy-handed messages, particularly a recurring theme about how women don’t need men to save them. While empowerment is important, the execution here felt more like overcorrection than inspiration—and it came at the cost of good storytelling.

The Seven Dwarfs, once central to Snow White’s charm and growth, are now barely recognizable, reduced to minimal screen time and awkward CGI. Their personalities and relationships with Snow White—core to the original story—are largely dismissed. And that begs the question: why adapt a classic if you’re going to strip away the soul that made it beloved?

“Mirror, mirror on the wall…” This version isn’t the fairest of them all—not by a long shot. It’s hard not to leave disappointed when nostalgia and enchantment are replaced by messaging over magic.

Here’s hoping Disney rediscovers its storytelling roots. We need wonder and whimsy again—not just propaganda.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Gal’s makeup looked dry, especially her lips which were also blotchy and the prince/thief looked like he had a cut from Full House in the 90’s. The costume design was also cheap imo.

The pacing is uneven — too much time is spent on slapstick gags with the dwarfs, while the main plot feels rushed and underdeveloped. The Evil Queen is the only character with any real presence, but even her motivations are simplistic and unexplored.
Visually, while it was groundbreaking in its time, the animation now feels dated and stiff in places. The music, though nostalgic for some, comes across as repetitive and uninspired by modern standards.
Ultimately, Snow White is more important for its historical significance than its actual storytelling quality. For new viewers, especially children used to richer narratives and stronger characters, it’s likely to feel dull and outdated.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

I feel like we all need to learn to stop judging things before we see it and off of other peoples opinions. Cancel culture is out of hand. 

Also… has Rachel Ziegler said stupid things? Yes, we all have. But all the hate/straight up bullying for her appearance is absolutely disgusting and we as people need to do better. That hair dresser needs to get fired asap though… they did her soooooo dirty.

The trailers looked fantastic with the characters (Snow White and the Evil Queen), and don’t even get me started on the set design. Phenomenal! However, I felt greatly let down by the storyline and overall flow execution of this movie.

While I mostly like Rachel Ziegler’s performance as Snow White, there were parts in the movie that were so cringe that it was hard to pick up the storyline that they were bringing across in that moment. I don’t think they executed the romantic scenes well, the kissing scenes between Snow White and the ‘prince’ were really obviously staged and tensely unrealistic.

Multiple character choices in the film left me dissatisfied. Firstly, THE DWARFS!! They used CGI to make these little guys, and while I think they did look alright, why not cast actors with dwarfism instead, as it would hold the authentication and nostalgia of the film, and make them seem more real. I also would have liked to see them be more central characters in the film, as they seem very much as background characters which I believe comes down to the writers going in the wrong direction and trying to modernise this classic to much. Which subsequently, negatively affected the final result.

The pacing and storyline timing was also very poorly done. I felt like for most of the movie I was just sitting, waiting for it to get good and for it to properly kick off but it never did. This is by far most evident in when Snow White is staying with the dwarfs. Give us more of her living with them please, as I feel like she just goes in there, sings a song and then leaves.

Honestly, I was giving the movie a solid chance as I wanted to like it, but about half way through I couldn’t lie to myself anymore. It was cringy cheesy crap for the most part. Slow paced, mostly weird and forgettable songs, and great lack of character development which makes it feel so distant from the original. I will say, due to all the hype Disney has given it, if you went to see it, you WILL BE DISAPPOINTED on some level.","You and 38 other people found this helpful.","38 people found this helpful."

Two models are currently offered: a trimotor all-wheel drive (AWD) model called Cyberbeast, and a dual-motor AWD model. A single-motor rear-wheel drive (RWD) model is slated to be available in 2025. EPA range estimates cover 250–340 miles (400–550 km), varying by model.[7][8] The Cybertruck is only sold in the United States and Canada.Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ideas for a pickup truck were first stated publicly in 2012 and 2013, envisioning to build a ""Tesla supertruck with crazy torque, dynamic air suspension, and corners like it's on rails"".[10] In early 2014 Musk predicted 4–5 years before work could start on the product, then in a 2015 interview with CNN, Musk stated that the Tesla pickup would be the equivalent of a Ford F-150.[10] In mid-2016, the outline for a consumer pickup truck was included in part 2 of the Tesla Master Plan.[11][12][13] Musk suggested that the same chassis could be used for a van and a pickup truck.[14] In 2017, Musk teased the picture of a ""pickup truck that can carry a pickup truck"" was displayed at the official reveal for the Tesla Semi and Roadster.[10]

In March 2019, following the Tesla Model Y launch, Musk distributed a teaser image of a vehicle described as having a cyberpunk or Blade Runner style, with the form resembling a futuristic armored personnel carrier. It was rumored to be named the Model B.[15][16][17] On November 6, 2019, Tesla filed for a trademark on ""Cybrtrk"", which was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office but was later abandoned on August 10, 2020","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

There’s no heart, no magic, no point. Just a megaphone screaming ""late-stage capitalism bad"" while animated dwarfs nod in agreement.

The acting? Let’s just say I’ve seen more believable performances in middle school plays… where the actors were actually asleep. Snow White spends most of the film either gasping dramatically or staring blankly into space like she forgot her lines. The Evil Queen was about as menacing as a wet paper towel, and her motivations made less sense than a raccoon in a tuxedo.

The dialogue sounded like it was written by an AI that only read motivational Pinterest quotes and forgot how humans talk. ""Believe in yourself, Snow!"" No thanks, I’ll believe in the exit sign instead.

Let’s not even talk about the visuals. The CGI forest animals looked like taxidermy from a haunted museum, and the magical effects had the budget of a late-night infomercial. I’ve seen better effects on YouTube fan edits made in 2007.

Also, why were the dwarfs renamed, rewritten, and reduced to random background filler? I came here for grumpy, sneezy, and the gang — not seven guys who look like they got lost on the way to Coachella.

The pacing dragged like a drunk turtle through molasses, and by the time it hit the climax (if you can call it that), I was rooting for the poisoned apple just to end it all.

Honestly Disney goes on and on about inclusive and equity yet they literally took roles away from a little person. They are so scared of offending people that they shoot themselves in the foot. The music numbers were also bland and forgetful. I was getting over Lin Manuel Miranda getting everything but I longer for him everytime a musical number came on. I'd have to say that I much rather 2012 Snow White and the Huntsman to this movie. The cast for that movie actually did an awesome job as their respective characters. Theron being the stand out as the Queen.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Happy who was known to be overbearingly happy, was barely happy. Considering they were AI generated, I was expecting them to be more animated in the way they moved, more familiar in the way they looked etc.

*Snow White*
The young girl that played the child snow white, was lovely, perfect for the role.
Rachel Zelga, who played the grown up Snow White however, would be much more suited to a theater performance than for this. I am so very confused why they casted her to play the most iconic, and first ever Disney Princess. This was the biggest flaw of the whole film. She has no sweet, softly spoken voice, very little grace in her movements, no ""skin as white as snow"". You could even tell her heart wasn't even into the role. Not including how she spoke negatively in interviews about the original Snow White.
She sung wonderfully, but it really did end there.

*Prince Charming*
Unfortunately Disney fell suit with the ""woke generation"" and there was No Prince Charming! 
There was - Jonathan, a town thief and basically a mix between Aladdin and Robin Hood.

*Other*
The Evil Queen was an amazing actress. She really did do wonders for the film.
AI animals were beautifully done.

*Songs*
Most of the songs were different, they had two originals I think, which were Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work.
One of the new songs - Princess Problems was brilliant too.

For a remake of the first ever Disney Film, you'd think Disney would pull out all of their best work to do it justice. It was a less than average film, one that I wouldn't chose to watch again unfortunately. Such huge potential, entangled with great disappointment.

Yes the prince saved snow white in the original, but it didn't place men on a higher pedestal than women, I mean, snow white had to take care of 7 MALE dwarves who were not smart enough to take care of themselves the way that they should have been doing....they NEEDED snow whites assistance and didn't realize it until they met her..I think the original film played on the strength AND the flaws of men...and the strength that a women can show when a man needs a solid rock to lean on...these people find negativity in Absolutely everything.



Let's look past the fact that the head actress said she hopes that half of the American population will never find happiness and peace within themselves [ all because of who they voted for ]


Let's look past the fact that they used horrible cgi dwarves instead of employing real people that would have loved to play the roles and would have loved the pay day and recognition 



Let's look past the fact that she is so toxic towards men that disney literally changed the ending of the film to make the prince no longer the ""savior""

the seven dwarves went from lovable characters to side gag characters who crack jokes every 5 minutes. 
the story of rachel zeggler being a princess was a nice take but the writing and plot ruined that take. 
the side characters in the kingdom needed way more time to shine in the beginning and throughout have the queen make a unfair law to them. 
the snow white death was not felt at all I feel like adding the forest friends took away from building that moment up. 
In the original there was so much dead space with cleaning that this movie could have taken advantage of with this plot they were trying to do but adding the forest friends,not caring about the dwarves and not showing the queen and her decisions as menancing ruined it.

But giving this film 1 star without even seeing it does a disservice to the fact that they actually listened to their audience. They took time (a year and a half!) to edit and respond to concerns, and the result is a movie that’s clean, fun, and refreshingly agenda-free.

And more importantly—it’s a great movie. It’s heartwarming, super happy, and genuinely entertaining. Kids loved it, and so did we. The storytelling is strong, the visuals are beautiful, and the energy is pure joy. If this film had gone political or tried to rewrite a classic to push a message, I’d be the first to say so.

Well, Disney’s latest Snow White reboot is here—because apparently, the studio thought what the world really needed was a politically correct fever dream disguised as a fairy tale. Let’s dive in, shall we?

First off, Snow White herself is about as charming as a damp napkin. She’s less “fairest of them all” and more “emotionally unavailable LinkedIn coach.” Gone is the innocence, replaced with a smugness that could outshine a ring light on max brightness. She doesn’t talk to animals anymore—probably because even they got tired of her TED Talks on empowerment.

Prince Charming? Blink and you’ll miss him. Literally. He has all the screen time of a guest star on a cooking show and the chemistry of unbuttered toast.

The dwarfs? Oh wait—sorry, the “magical forest companions.” Disney’s desperate backpedal from traditional characters gave us a troupe that looks like the result of bad AI image generation. They each have one trait: Confused, Slightly Confused, and Confused But Holding a Stick.

The visuals are like a budget cosplay TikTok with a Marvel filter. The forest looks fake, the castle looks faker, and the CGI apple had more life than most of the cast.

And the moral of the story? Apparently: “You don’t need a prince, you need a boardroom.” Snow White is no longer a dreamer singing to birds—she’s an HR rep who filed a complaint against the mirror for toxic masculinity.

In conclusion, if you’re looking for the magic of Disney classics, go rewatch the 1937 version. If you’re looking for an identity crisis with a side of glitter and dialogue that sounds like it was written by a Twitter bot, Snow White 2025 is for you.

Im really not asking for much and dont need an actor to agree with me in everything. But hiring someone who hates the source material is just mindboggling and I feel asking for an actor to like the story they are apart of is the BARE minimum. Yet they hire someone who is rude and hateful towards the thing she should be passionate about. Please be aware of what you are supporting as giving these movies money only allows the same trend to continue. Its tiring to see film directors and actors alike ruin works because they Don't like what the past works have been. It happens with star wars and several other projects. Keep tanking these movies till we go back to the bare minimum. Which is watching what we paid for not what someone else wanted us to watch.

The casting of Rachel Zegler as Snow White is uninspired, and her portrayal lacks the innocence and charm that made the original character so beloved. Gal Gadot’s performance as the Evil Queen is equally underwhelming, failing to capture the menace and allure required for the role. The film’s heavy reliance on digital imagery results in a visually discordant mess, leaving audiences yearning for the hand-drawn artistry of the original. Furthermore, the modernized plot changes feel forced and unnecessary, alienating longtime fans and diluting the story’s timeless appeal. Critics have rightly lambasted the film, with The Guardian describing it as “toe-curlingly terrible”  and HuffPost branding it a “hot mess” . In summary, this remake is an abomination that should never have seen the light of day, serving as a stark reminder that some classics are best left untouched. ￼ ￼ ￼","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

But the movie was confusing. 
Was the Step Mother involved in the murder of Snow White's Father just so she can take his thrown and kill Snow White to keep her from creating an army to start a political and military coup? 

Or was the Kingdom under threatened by other Kingdoms so Snow White's father went to the Front Lines, only to be killed, and the Step Mother distraught over her lover's death 
took all her angst at Snow White almost resulting to wanting to kill her because.... as a queen its her job to maintain law and order and punish all traitors in time of war, even if the traitor can be her very own Step Daughter?

And Snow White only role in this story (really) is to avenge the death of her father by building an army, over throw the queen, and take back the thrown Snow White says she is entitled to ?

	2.	The costumes look really cheap… and the makeup doesn’t suit her either. She’s not actually that bad, but the styling makes her look worse than she should.
	3.	The plot has a lot of inconsistencies. In the original animated film, Snow White wasn’t famous for just being pretty—she was known for her innocence and kindness, which was shown through her singing and her bond with animals (not just animals randomly helping her out like in this film). The Huntsman didn’t spare her because of some forced reason; it was because he saw her comforting a lost bird, helping it find its parents.
	•	This version tries to make Snow White independent and self-reliant while also not wanting to change too much from the original (like keeping the animal friendship aspect). They tried to have it both ways, and it just doesn’t make sense.
	4.	There are a lot of plot holes. If the Magic Mirror judges by inner beauty, then it shouldn’t have called the Queen the fairest in the first place. And if the Queen decided to kill Snow White because she was “more beautiful on the inside,” wouldn’t that completely defeat the purpose?
	5.	If you’re going to make major changes, then just call it an adaptation rather than a “live-action Snow White.” People watch these films expecting them to feel like the originals. If you want to promote diversity, make new stories that actually fit that message, instead of forcing changes on iconic characters like Ariel and Snow White, where certain key elements shouldn’t be altered.

P.S. They also changed the Prince, which meant they cut some of the classic songs—another major disappointment for me.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The way she was singing was like Regina George from the Mean Girls Musical, with no evil-tone, no wickedness, and no anger or revenge. Just preppy, teenage, karaoke singing! 

And Rachel playing Snow White, I’m not sorry…. But Snow White is called Snow White because of her SNOW WHITE skin, and this character was lightskin, so it was honestly more like “Snow Brown”. Rachel’s acting was very rehearsed and read off paper throughout the entire movie, and she thinks the movie is all about her, completely disregarding the thought of the character going out to children, adults, and honoring Snow White. 

Rachel ruined this little woke, fuckass-film. Wasted my 14.63 dollars.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The whole thing was clunky and awkward, from the weirdly political messages shoved into the story to the lifeless CGI effects. The dwarfs looked like they were pulled from some cheap video game, and the songs were forgettable at best, painfully sung at worst. It was just boring.  

Visually, things weren’t any better. Rachel Zegler’s acting felt flat, like she didn’t really want to be there, and her hairstyle? I couldn’t stop thinking about Lord Farquaad from *Shrek*. It was just bizarre. And then there’s the whole scene where Snow White, instead of being grateful for the dwarfs' hospitality, basically orders them to clean while she sings and whistles. These guys just spent all day working in a mine, and now they have to scrub the floors for a total stranger? The prince—oh wait, sorry, *Jonathan*—was also barely recognizable. His whole character felt like it was there just to make some point instead of being an actual charming love interest.  

By the time we left the theater, we were both feeling let down, so I suggested we go home and watch the original *Snow White*. And what a breath of fresh air that was! The animation, the music, the charm—everything the new version lacked. My daughter was completely enchanted, and honestly, so was I. It just proved how unnecessary and soulless this remake was. Some classics should just be left alone.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

The first film, based on the 1998 Vibe magazine article ""Racer X"" by Ken Li and written by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer, was released in 2001. It began the original tetralogy of films focused on illegal street racing, which culminated in the film Fast & Furious (2009). The series moved towards heists and spying with Fast Five (2011), which was followed by five sequels in that genre, the most recent of which, Fast X, was released on May 19, 2023.

Universal expanded the series to include the spin-off film Hobbs & Shaw (2019), while its subsidiary DreamWorks Animation followed this with the six-season animated streaming television series Fast & Furious Spy Racers (2019–2021). Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films, as well as compilation albums containing existing music heard in the films. Two short films that tie into the series have also been released.

The series has been commercially successful. It is Universal's biggest franchise and the eighth highest-grossing film series of all-time, with a combined gross of over $7 billion.[2] Critical reception for the first four films was mixed until the fifth and later films, which were more positively received.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

*1/5 Stars: A Soulless, CGI-Infested Mess*

I just had the misfortune of watching Disney's live-action remake of Snow White, and I'm still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. Not because it was breathtakingly good, but because it was astoundingly bad.

First off, the CGI was atrocious. The visuals were cartoonish, lacking any semblance of realism. The characters' interactions with the environment felt like they belonged in a PS2 game, not a big-budget Hollywood film. It's mind-boggling how Disney, with all its resources, couldn't even be bothered to get the basics right.

And don't even get me started on the acting. The cast seemed to be sleepwalking through their roles, delivering wooden performances that lacked any depth or emotion. Snow White herself came across as more of a prop than a fully fleshed-out character.

But what really grates is that this movie doesn't even attempt to look like a live-action film. The scenes are overly staged, with characters posing and posturing like they're in a bad high school production. Where's the grit? The realism? The sense of wonder?

The original animated Snow White, released over 80 years ago, is still a masterpiece. It's a beautifully crafted film with memorable characters, catchy songs, and a timeless story. This remake, on the other hand, feels like a cynical cash-grab, devoid of heart, soul, or imagination.

*Avoid this mess at all costs.* Watch the original instead. Your eyes (and your sanity) will thank you.

*Positives:* Um... the movie ended eventually?

*Negatives:* Everything else.","You and 192 other people found this helpful.","192 people found this helpful."

Ah, Disney. The once-beloved studio that brought us timeless classics has now given us… whatever this is. Gone is the magic, the heart, and the storytelling. Instead, we have a painfully forced, agenda-driven train wreck that takes a beloved fairy tale and smashes it to pieces with a hammer labeled “WOKE.”

Let’s start with the obvious: this isn’t Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Oh no, that would be too problematic. Instead, we get Pitch Black and the Seven Abominations, a lineup so unrecognizable that even Tolkien’s orcs would be embarrassed to be seen with them. Instead of the lovable dwarfs with distinct personalities, we get a collection of… creatures. I’d describe them further, but I honestly don’t know what they’re supposed to be.

Then, of course, there’s Snow White herself. Except she’s neither Snow nor White. The original tale’s entire premise is thrown in the trash because “who needs accuracy when we have modern activism?” The Evil Queen was right—this version of Snow White isn’t the fairest of them all, just the most self-righteous.

The Prince? Gone. Romance? Gone. Any semblance of joy? Gone. Instead, we get a strong, independent protagonist who don’t need no prince (or coherent plot). The message is loud and clear: If you enjoyed the original, you’re the problem.

Disney, you did it again. You proved, once and for all, that if you go woke, you go broke. Maybe instead of butchering classics to push an agenda, you could try—oh, I don’t know—telling a good story? But hey, I’m sure the 10 people on Twitter who demanded these changes are thrilled. Meanwhile, audiences everywhere are walking out of theaters in stunned silence, wondering how this mess ever got greenlit.

Most classics are sidelined or reworked to the point of being unrecognizable. Visually, the film tries to look “magical,” but the CGI-heavy environments feel lifeless and artificial. There’s no soul here, just glossy production and forced moralizing. Disney had an opportunity to modernize a classic while still honoring its legacy. Instead, they delivered a cynical, soulless retread that satisfies no one.

With the sheer amount of CGI and animation, it seems like it was unnecessary to have human actors. I don't think it should be called live action, especially when compared to movies such as Mulan (2020), Cinderella (2015), or even Aladdin (2019). 

It was bizarre to see the character of Snow White after hearing Rachel talk about her pre-release. I went in expecting a feminist girl-boss and instead got Snow White (a good thing, but again not what I expected).

I really really disliked the opening ten minutes of the movie. Genuinely wanted to stop watching but I was in a dopamine spiral and got stuck. It felt unpleasant and overly sugary and gross. You have this random king, queen, and their daughter sing at me even before I as an audience member have built a relationship with them. If the movie started by building characters and creating investment in their wellbeing, I think that whole opening song would have fit great.

I did appreciate combining some of the Robin Hood storyline into Snow White's storyline and I think it fit in quite well. I also appreciated that Snow White got the Dwarves to clean the house, it created a lovely bonding scene. I also appreciated Dopey's character development though I would have appreciated more of it.

I did not like how fast Snow White and Jonathan decided they loved each other. Haters to lovers is a great storyline but you gotta have sauce, and this just lacked sauce. 

TLDR; Overall less live action, more animated film; really bad start; Robin Hood x Snow White works well; Snow and Jon lack the sauce. Not a 1 star film but not something I'd watch again. 2.5 star rating from me :)","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Don't listen to the critics- I doubt any of them have seen the movie. Visually stunning, incredible music, great choreography and acting. Rachel Zegler is the PERFECT snow white and has the most gorgeous voice. The changes to the story are refreshing and inspiring. The new songs are so good.

Visually, the film leans too heavily on CGI, creating a lifeless, artificial aesthetic that feels more like a video game than a fairy tale. The modernized script tries to be progressive but ends up feeling forced and awkward, losing the timeless magic of the original story.

The pacing drags, the humor falls flat, and the emotional beats feel hollow. With a bloated budget and lackluster execution, Snow White (2025) proves yet again that not every classic needs a live-action remake—especially one this forgettable.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Walt made the original animated movie in 1937 as a story about hope and kindness during the great depression, at a time when more women than ever are entering the workforce as working conditions are at the most difficult and unsafe. The original was a charming story that gave people suffering an escape with a fairy tale where goodness, friendship, and love conquers evil. Snow White in the original was kind, carring, and just wanted to feel safe and loved; something anyone can relate too even today. Which is why the original story has stood the test of time. THIS remake Snow White, is about an entailed brat that complains and bullies people until she gets what she wants. Zegler's Snow White is awful, mean, and dismissive even to the people who are helping her. Andrew's (not prince) character takes an arrow for her and she still treats him like dirt. Meanwhile Zegler's Snow White keeps yapping about being a leader without displaying anything that would make her a good ruler. Her line about making the suffering people pies is very reminiscent of Marie Antoinette's ""Let them eat cake"" I can't believe how tone deaf this film is about what it's trying (and failing) to preach. There was no reason to even call this movie Snow White, it obviously a completely different story but Disney executives where cowards and just slapped the name Snow White on it as a way to get people to see it. This movie isn't ""empowering"" if anything it just makes women look useless, mean, and entitled without any skills or merit. The original Snow White was gentle, helpful, and did whatever she could to help those around her even when she was the one suffering the most. The 1937 Snow White took charge in a way that showed how much she cared for everyone and is far more of a feminist than whatever Zegler is trying to do here. Also the queen in this version is boring and can't sing. you'd think the company would have learned a long time ago to hire actors and actresses who can actually sing for their musicals.","You and 224 other people found this helpful.","224 people found this helpful."

The forest and the kingdom were rendered wonderfully. Everything was a visual feast and the set design was incredible. I will say that the CGI did not exactly work out with the dwarves, as I think they look a little funky. Speaking of the dwarves, I think that the Dopey storyline was really well executed and added a lot to the plot, especially at the end of the movie. 

The story, overall, was decent. They added large chunks to establish the kingdom better and explain the resistance against the queen. The plot felt relatively cohesive and more mature than Princess Eats Apple and Dies. They did change Prince Charming into the leader of the bandit revolutionaries, which I thought was interesting. However, I feel like the romance between him and Snow White felt rushed and there wasn’t any build up. 

I say if you’re interested, you should give this movie a chance. Don’t listen to the haters because whatever you’re picturing, it’s probably worse.","You and 6 other people found this helpful.","6 people found this helpful."

The ending is so bleh that I was like what is even happening.

It’s a catastrophic failure, a perfect example of what happens when creativity is sacrificed at the altar of social agendas.

However, there is a line in German which translates to: “Skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony” (also red cheeks) which clarifies some aspects of her appearance. Also the story is German so it is assumed by the description that she is a European girl. So, why change it? I’m an ethnic girl and I would rather see someone who looks and vocally sounds more like the original Snow White. Personally. Rachel’s vocals are incredible, very talented, but it’s not Snow White. In any case I don’t think I’d be happy seeing Mulan being played by an Indian woman even though I am part Indian; because it would be strange and not authentic to the story. Also the CGI dwarves were not as good as I had hoped; the emotion was lacking. There was just a lot of strange elements to this new version. Rachel’s hair is also absurd… truly who did that? Looks like a mushroom. Also, the costumes are just… not. Not pleasant, not pretty, not Disney. Most of this movie was just a colossal mess. Some of the songs are good, and I’m sure it took a lot of work to create this film; as the scenes are remarkably well done… but just don’t change the plot, or her voice, or her look so much? :/","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

Snow White herself is less of a protagonist and more of a decorative object being moved around the story with zero agency. It’s hard to root for someone who barely seems aware of what’s happening around her.

The humor doesn’t land, the dialogue is painfully simplistic, and the dwarfs—while iconic in name—are just cartoonish stereotypes with no real depth. I understand this was a product of its time, but that doesn't excuse how flat and dull everything feels. Even the villain, who should be a highlight, is reduced to melodramatic overacting and weak motivations.

Visually, it's dated—which is expected—but even so, the animation doesn’t hold up in a way that compensates for the movie's many flaws. I wasn’t expecting Pixar-level polish, but I was hoping for at least some sense of magic or charm. Instead, it felt like a chore to get through.

If this is considered a classic, it's only because of historical significance—not quality. Snow White is, unfortunately, a relic that hasn’t aged well, and watching it today only highlights how far storytelling and animation have come. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who values plot, character development, or emotional depth.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

From the very first scene, something felt off. The dwarves, sorry, the ""magical creatures"", are so forgettable I couldn't tell you a single thing about them five minutes after the movie ended. The Evil Queen, once one of Disney's greatest villains, now delivers motivational speaker monologues instead of chilling threats. ""Mirror, mirror on the wall"" has all the menace of a corporate diversity training video.

The visuals? A strange mix of cheap-looking CGI and costumes that seem like they were pulled from a discount Halloween store. The forest doesn't feel enchanted, just green. The apple scene, which should be tense and dramatic, falls completely flat. Even the music, usually Disney's strong point, is so bland I couldn't hum a single tune afterward.
What hurts the most is how unnecessary this all feels. Nobody asked for a Snow White stripped of her fairy tale soul. Nobody wanted a lecture disguised as a children's movie. And worst of all, nobody, least of all the kids in the theater, walked out feeling that old Disney magic.
I took my niece and nephew hoping for wonder. Instead, they just kept asking when it would be over. :( And honestly? So did I.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The beginning felt a little bit boring, and I think some scenes were dragged out for way too long.

Gal Gadot, while performing decently and dressed spectacularly, did not seem threatening enough but I don’t think that is her fault. The issue is the script accompanied by poor directing. In the original Snow White, she appears to be much more intimidating and the abuse towards Snow White is more evident, especially with her being dressed in literal rags and treated like a slave, which really highlights how cruel she is.

The song she sings wasn’t very evil or villainous, more like just a “Look at me! Look how regal and fierce I am!” sort of thing. It irked me a little bit.

I don’t like the CGI dwarves or animals (although some animal scenes were cute). I think using real people in place of the dwarves and involving some real animals would have made this movie better. Makeup and costumes could’ve been better as well (specifically Snow White’s, the villagers, Jonathan and his crew’s). 

Jonathan had a Flynn Rider kind of vibe, and that’s cool (I guess?), but his character seemed out of place. The romance between him and Snow White was also too rushed and lacked relationship development. I’m a hopeless romantic who believes in love at first sight, but there was no spark at all here.

I believe most (if any) of the magic in this movie came from Rachel Zegler. She’s so cute and talented! The songs she sang were good, but not the best fit for the movie. I am sad that Someday My Prince Will Come wasn’t in it, that’s my favorite Disney song.

Snow White gets 2 stars. Disney, no offense, but you haven’t made a good movie in a very long time. I honestly probably wouldn’t watch this one
again. But I believe it was OKAY enough for children to enjoy.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Worst of all, the movie seems more concerned with making a statement than actually being enjoyable.

Hollywood keeps churning out this kind of content, and audiences are getting tired of it.

The changes are jarring and forced, feeling like a desperate attempt to appease modern sensibilities rather than a genuine retelling of the story. The characters are all given awkward, contrived backstories that serve only to hammer home the film's ideological messages.

The Evil Queen is now a ""complex, nuanced"" character with a ""valid"" reason for being evil, while Snow White is a generic, bland ""girlboss"" type. The dwarfs are all given ridiculous, anachronistic personalities and quirks that feel like they were ripped straight from a Diversity and Inclusion workshop.

The film's themes are shallow and preachy, with the whole thing feeling like a cynical attempt to cash in on the latest social justice trends. The dialogue is stilted and cringe-worthy, with characters spouting off woke jargon like they're reading from a script written by a committee of Diversity and Inclusion experts.

Overall, Snow White 2025 is a disaster. It's a soulless, cynical remake that fails to deliver on its promise. Avoid this film at all costs. 0/10 would not recommend.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

What once was a charming fairy tale is now a soulless, self-righteous mess desperately trying to be relevant. The heartwarming innocence of the original is replaced with a smug, heavy-handed agenda that beats the audience over the head at every turn. It’s not storytelling—it’s a lecture with costumes.

Rachel Zegler, unfortunately, is completely miscast. Her portrayal of Snow White is devoid of warmth, charisma, or even basic likability. Rather than enchanting, she comes off as condescending and bored, like she’s too good for the role she’s playing—and maybe she is, given the script she had to work with. There’s no growth, no emotion—just a wooden performance delivered with the energy of a student forced to give a group project presentation.

The dwarfs—if you can even call them that anymore—are stripped of personality, chemistry, and purpose. Their reimagining is baffling, joyless, and completely forgettable. It’s as if Disney was more afraid of offending someone than creating characters people could actually care about.

Visually, it’s a chaotic blend of overprocessed CGI and lifeless set pieces. It looks more like a theme park promo reel than a major motion picture. The music? Bland. The pacing? Glacial. The dialogue? Unbearable.

Disney has turned one of its most iconic stories into a joyless, preachy, creatively bankrupt disaster. If the original Snow White was a dream, this remake is a nightmare—and not the kind you wake up from any time soon.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Rather than embracing the legacy of the projects she’s a part of, she talks down to both longtime fans and the very stories that made her career possible. It’s no surprise that so many (including myself) hope she’s never cast in anything again. Hollywood should prioritize true talent, professionalism, and respect for audiences instead of rewarding arrogance. Go woke, go broke.

Once upon a time, Disney remade classics with care. Now, they just slap a fresh coat of social commentary on a beloved tale, toss in a CGI deer, and call it a day. Snow White (2025) is less a movie and more a confused TED Talk dressed in medieval cosplay.

The magic mirror must’ve shattered from secondhand embarrassment after hearing this script. Snow White isn’t so much a character as she is a walking Twitter thread, spouting lines that sound like they were brainstormed in a corporate diversity seminar. Prince Charming? Who needs him! Or apparently, any actual charm. The dwarfs? Don’t ask. They’re here, sort of, but it’s hard to tell if they’re supposed to be a metaphor, a checklist, or just unpaid interns in costume.

Visually, it’s bland. The CGI forest looks like it was rendered in 2010, and the costumes have the personality of a department store clearance rack. Even the poisoned apple looked bored.

In the end, Snow White (2025) is what happens when a studio tries so hard to avoid offending anyone that they forget to entertain everyone. A joyless, preachy mess that forgets the point of fairy tales: wonder, whimsy, and just a little bit of wickedness.

In their quest to check every inclusivity box, the film forgot to include charm, coherence, or, ironically, magic.

Gone is the mirror-mirror elegance, replaced by lectures on empowerment so heavy-handed even the magic mirror cracked under the weight. The once whimsical woodland creatures now feel like diversity consultants in CGI form, guiding our heroine — sorry, “protagonist” — through a forest of forced messaging.

Box office returns? As small as the dwarves they replaced.

There literally was no “love” or connection between the protagonist and the thief and then midway through - now they’re signing a song together that even during it shows no connection. 

The lines… just bad writing. Can’t even blame the cast although the casting was just a mess too. That’s been one of my biggest quips about these live action remakes. If you’re going to pick someone to play a part - pick someone who can actually sing. Avoid the popularity contest and give someone unknown the chance at stardom. 

The dwarves were a mess. Sonic was saved by the internet but it seems the public didn’t rally enough to do the same with Snow White 😕. They’re rallying now in protest of this debacle of a film. 

I had hoped for better but I’m also not surprised. Quality has not been one of Disney’s considerations for some time now. Imagine creating this and thinking to yourself, “Yeah… it’s all coming together. This will be great!”

Many fans feel that if you’re going to change this much, why even call it Snow White?

1. The Removal of Key Elements

One of the biggest criticisms of the 2024 Snow White remake is how much it changes from the original. The seven dwarfs have been largely replaced with a diverse group of characters, and the classic love story with the prince has been downplayed. Many fans feel that if you’re going to change this much, why even call it Snow White?

2. Rachel Zegler’s Controversial Comments

The lead actress, Rachel Zegler, didn’t help the movie’s reputation with her public statements. She openly criticized the original 1937 Snow White, calling it outdated and problematic. While some agreed, many saw it as disrespectful to Disney’s first-ever animated film. Instead of promoting the remake, her comments made fans more upset.

3. The “Girlboss” Rewrite Feels Forced

Disney has been trying to modernize its princesses by making them more independent, but this version of Snow White takes it to an extreme. She no longer wants love or romance; instead, she wants to be a leader. While strong female characters are great, this change feels more like a corporate checklist than genuine character growth.

4. Weak Visuals and Design

Many Disney live-action remakes have been criticized for looking bland, and Snow White is no exception. The CGI for the dwarfs looks strange, the costumes seem cheap, and the overall visual style lacks the magic of the animated classic. Even the Evil Queen, usually a standout character, feels uninspired.

5. Lack of Audience Interest

From the start, audiences weren’t excited about this remake. The drastic changes, poor marketing, and backlash against Zegler’s comments all contributed to a lack of enthusiasm. It feels like Disney made this movie because they had to, rather than because they had a good story to tell.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Tbh, it’s not entirely Rachel’s fault she’s getting so much hate—it’s also Disney’s. They really need to stop with the bizarre casting choices.

Trashing the original story, mocking the fans—what did she expect? The irony is, after all that talk about how she’d ""fix"" the character, her performance ended up being utterly forgettable.

And let’s talk about the costumes. Snow White’s outfit looks cheap, unflattering, and straight-up uninspired. And that hairstyle? Who approved that mess? It doesn’t do Zegler any favours, not that she was helping herself much anyway.

Snow White and the Huntsman,  Mirror Mirror, Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarves,  Happily Ever After,  and multiple others.  There are at least 51 screen adaptations of the Snow White story.  Has Disney completely run out of original ideas?!  Instead of picking up a story that was done badly and redoing it WELL (Eragon would be a great choice), or taking a NEW IDEA and turning it into something,  they just wasted money ruining a perfectly good cartoon movie.

Instead of bringing a fresh yet elegant update to her classic look, the costume design falls flat, lacking the richness and fairy-tale charm that made the original so visually memorable.

Another issue is the unnecessary changes to the storyline. Snow White is a beloved classic for a reason, and altering key elements takes away from the magic that made it special in the first place. Fans expected a faithful adaptation, but instead, they got something that feels disconnected from the original fairy tale.

Then there’s the casting. While diversity in films is important, the choices here felt more like forced changes rather than natural, well-thought-out decisions. Casting should enhance the story, not take away from it. The original characters had specific traits that made them iconic, and changing them so drastically just makes it feel like an entirely different movie instead of a faithful remake.

Overall, Disney had the potential to create something magical, but instead, it feels like they missed the mark. The lack of effort in the dress, the unnecessary storyline changes, and the controversial casting decisions make this remake feel more like a misguided reimagining than a celebration of a timeless classic.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

The much-discussed CGI dwarfs are a visual nightmare. They hover in that uncanny valley, where they're neither realistic nor charmingly cartoonish, just…off. It's distracting and, at times, genuinely unsettling.
 
The new musical numbers are utterly forgettable. They lack the iconic magic of the original, replaced with bland, generic pop tunes that feel shoehorned in.
 
 The narrative feels disjointed, prioritizing certain messages over coherent storytelling. The pacing is erratic, with long stretches of boredom punctuated by moments of jarringly bad CGI action.

It’s so sad the public pictured Snow White as a “damsel in distress” because she fell for Prince Charming and cleaned or whatever. She was soft and gentle, and just because she didn’t fit modern days feminist norms doesn’t make her a weak woman. 

 Rachel Zegler was not THE Snow White. Her singing was beautiful but not enough for her to carry Disney’s all time classic. I don’t know how she got the role. Snow White was an every little girls childhood and the love story is beautiful. Rachel doesn’t even like the story Snow White and she has stated in many interviews that the story is creepy and outdated. HOW CAN YOU CAST SOMEONE WHO HATES A MOVIE TO BE THE MAIN CHARACTER!!

Not only that but Disney tries so hard to be inclusive. They have to change every white skinned character to be darker like if it’s a crime to be white skinned? SNOW WHITE IS CALLED SNOW WHITE BECAUSE SHE IS WHITE AS SNOW. It’s not snow brown!? Plus before that Snow White was European fairy tale. 

Yet again Disney ruined another classic. Someone please tell them to stop ruining old movies and just make new princess movies without pushing the “I don’t need a prince” storyline it’s getting annoying.

Instead of honoring the original 1937 classic, Disney has churned out a pseudo-progressive, lifeless adaptation that feels more like a lecture than a fairytale.

First off, the casting choices and script changes seem more focused on pushing modern messaging than actually telling a compelling story. Rachel Zegler’s take on Snow White lacks the charm and innocence of the original, and the film’s reimagining of the seven dwarfs—replacing them with a random, diverse group of characters—feels forced rather than innovative. Meanwhile, Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen is wasted in a movie that doesn’t even understand what made its villain iconic in the first place.

The visuals are polished but empty, the music is forgettable, and the heart of the original story has been completely gutted. Instead of a timeless fairytale about kindness and resilience, we get a dull, corporate-approved mess that no one asked for.

This is the perfect example of what’s wrong with modern Hollywood—lazy remakes that strip beloved classics of their soul in favor of box-checking and half-baked “updates.” If this is the future of cinema, we’re in trouble.","You and 25 other people found this helpful.","25 people found this helpful."

Ah yes, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the beloved Disney classic that, according to Rachel Zegler, is actually a problematic relic in desperate need of a rewrite. Gone is the princess who dares to fall in love—because nothing is more offensive than romance. Instead, we’ll get a bold, independent Snow White who doesn’t need a prince, dwarfs who are replaced with magical creatures (because reasons), and a villain who is apparently the real icon of the story.

The prince? Scrapped. The magic kiss? Unacceptable. Instead of a timeless fairy tale, we’ll get a soulless corporate-approved girlboss adventure where Snow White learns that love is irrelevant and ruling alone is way more empowering.

The irony? People have loved the original for nearly a century—not because it’s some deep feminist statement, but because it’s charming, well-made, and fun. No amount of modern moralizing will change that.

She might have been an okay actress in her early times but she’ll probably never be cast as a Star in a significant movie ever again. Which is entirely her fault by the way.

Visually, the film is a mess. Overproduced CGI clashes with dull realism, and the design choices feel uninspired and cheap, robbing the film of any magical atmosphere. The humor is forced and awkward, and the dialogue reads like a preachy social media post rather than meaningful storytelling.

Worst of all, the film tries to substitute genuine narrative with clumsy moralizing, treating its audience like a lecture hall rather than moviegoers seeking enchantment. It neither honors the original nor offers anything worthwhile in its place.

In short, this adaptation is a tone-deaf, creatively bankrupt attempt at modern relevance that fails on every level.

The casting choices, which sparked controversy long before the film’s release, don’t help either. While Rachel Zegler has an impressive singing voice, her performance lacks the warmth and charm needed to carry the role of Snow White. On top of that, her real-life comments about the original film only add to the frustration, making it hard to separate the actress from the character.

The film attempts to modernize the story but does so in a way that feels forced and out of touch rather than empowering. The writing is flat, the acting is cringeworthy, and the overall execution is lacking the Disney magic that made the 1937 classic so beloved.

The “dwarves”? Bro… don’t even get me started. I don’t know what the hell they were, but it sure as shit wasn’t Snow White.

Every line of dialogue made me want to slam my head into the seat in front of me. Who wrote this? Who directed this? Who let this abomination escape the cutting room floor?

This isn’t a movie. This is an anti-movie. It’s what you’d play to torture prisoners of war. Disney should be ashamed. Walt is doing backflips in his cryo chamber.

They didn't cute and bubbly like the original classic. Why didn't dopey didn't look dopey like the original? All the dwarf looked as if they pasted their faces on the actor.

Not interested in supporting project’s represented by Actors making hateful (political) commentary.  Rachel Ziegler, no thank you.  

I saw West Side story remake because of Spielberg.  I will never watch another film with the likes of Rachel Z.

How did the people in the Arts (Hollywood) not learn how to “lose”??

Perhaps she (& others) need a lesson in “sportsmanship”.  It’s having & displaying dignity when you LOSE a “race”.  A “race” means there is a winner and loser.

In contrast, the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs remains a masterpiece, setting the standard for animated storytelling. Its breathtaking hand-drawn animation, unforgettable music, and heartfelt characters capture the magic of classic Disney. Unlike the soulless modern adaptation, the original embraces innocence, kindness, and wonder—qualities that have made it endure for nearly a century. The 2025 remake is yet another example of Disney’s misguided attempts to “update” beloved films while stripping away everything that made them special.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

This is not just a failed remake but an attempt to rewrite German folklore to fit modern trends while ignoring the essence of the story.

The original Snow White, as clearly stated in the title, had skin as white as snow and hair as black as ebony. This is a crucial part of her character, established by the Brothers Grimm and deeply rooted in German folklore. However, the filmmakers completely disregarded this aspect, casting an actress who does not match the traditional description of the heroine. This is not about representation; it is a blatant distortion of cultural heritage.

An equally absurd change was replacing the word “dwarfs” with “magical creatures.” The claim that the term “dwarf” is offensive to short people is ridiculous. Dwarfs are not humans with a certain height; they are mythical beings that have been part of European folklore for centuries. Altering this detail does not make the film more inclusive—it only exposes the creators’ ignorance of the source material.

In the end, “Snow White” (2025) is not an adaptation but a meaningless rewrite that lacks respect for the original. Instead of preserving the spirit of the story, they butchered it under the guise of modernization. Rating: 1/5.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Like why are they even there and they don't even tell us their names. Also cgi is a huge part of this. I'm not a fan and the think dopey got wayyyy too much screen time. The villain was mid. I think the last half was torturously long and boring. To be fair I'm not a child. But I think there's a huge difference in live action Cinderella, beauty and this.1/5.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

The biggest issue? The lead actress. Not only is her performance flat and uninspired, but her press tour single-handedly ruined any goodwill this film might have had. Her dismissive attitude toward the original story and fans made it clear she had no respect for the material. It’s hard to root for a character when the actress playing her seems to dislike everything Snow White stands for.

The writing is another disaster. It’s preachy, lacking any of the whimsy and heart that made the original beloved. Instead of a fairytale, we get a bland, agenda-driven story that forgets what made Snow White special in the first place. The visuals may be decent, but they can’t save a film that feels so hollow.

Disney needs to learn that not every classic needs to be modernized into something unrecognizable. This was a complete failure, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who loved the original.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

The relationship with the guy was incredibly forced (no doubt put in due to the Drama during the press release stuff) and was just random and stupid. 

The part where she made the dwarves clean and made she sure she didn't do anything just screamed WAMIN POWER! 

The songs were awful! Hi OH song that the dwavers sing should NOT have been extended, me and my boyfriend both zoned out! 

The only half decent song was the Evil Queens villian song, that was catchy. 

Don't waste your time or if you do enjoy the zoning out sessions. Nothing happens for 40minutes and then you realise theres an hour left then its like WTF! 

I think the best part in this movie (yes there was a part I like) was that when Snow White ""died"" she never got placed in a beautiful glass coffin so she could be admired (in the OG i can't stop crying when the dwavers are huddle around her crying and all the animals, its so SAD!). In this one she gets placed on a rock slab and the dwavers just stand there awakward! It's so BAD! 

And to top it all off THEY MADE DOPEY TALK!!!! JUST NOOOOOO!!!!!

The story, instead of being a magical escape, is bogged down with awkward dialogue, forced messaging, and a total absence of emotional depth.

Visually, the film fails to impress. The CGI is inconsistent, the set design feels cheap, and the costumes lack the fantasy allure you’d expect from a Disney production. Even the iconic elements—like the dwarfs or the mirror—feel like afterthoughts.

And let’s talk about the pacing: it drags. Scenes that should be exciting or emotional fall completely flat, making it hard to stay invested.

In trying so hard to be “different” and “modern,” Disney has forgotten what made Snow White timeless in the first place—its innocence, its magic, and its sincerity. This remake isn’t just a misstep—it’s a total stumble.","You and 51 other people found this helpful.","51 people found this helpful."

The chemistry between characters was nonexistent, and Snow White (played by Rachel Zegler) came across more annoyed than inspiring.

The writing was stiff and awkward, with cringe-inducing lines like “I don’t need a prince—I lead with power!” shoved in every ten minutes. We get it. Empowerment is great, but subtlety matters. The Evil Queen was reduced to a shallow villain with zero real menace, and the mirror scene? Laughable. I felt secondhand embarrassment.

Visually, it tried to be “epic” with overdone CGI forests and weird dream sequences, but it all felt fake and empty. It’s like Disney took the name Snow White, threw out the charm, and handed the project to a committee with a checklist.

If you love the original tale—or even just good storytelling—skip this. It’s not a reimagining, it’s a soulless rebranding.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

If she didn’t respect the role or the story, why take it? It’s clear she was miscast from the start, and the studio’s decision to push this movie forward despite the backlash just proves they weren’t listening to their audience.

The film itself isn’t much better. The writing is bland, the visuals are uninspired, and the attempt to modernize the story completely misses the point of what made the original so timeless. This is yet another soulless remake that no one asked for, made worse by an actress who alienated the very fanbase that was supposed to support it.

Now, here is my opinion on why this was a bad movie.

******************** SPOILERS!!!!! ********************

The big problem with this movie, in my opinion, is that there were too many themes. Here are the ones that I counted:

1) Snow White being raised to be a leader
2) Snow White suffering
3) Snow White wanting to find out about her father
4) The kingdom starving
5) Snow White falling in love
6) Snow White vs the queen (trying to copy the lion king?)

The problem is that it's too many themes for a 100 minute movie (jeesh how was this not obvious to whoever wrote the script??). I understand that they wanted to give depth to snow white's character, but having so many themes and not going deeper into any of them hurts the character and makes the movie feel dissatisfying. The lack of depth in all of those themes made almost the entire movie feel like filler content, which is really bad. To successfully go through every single one those themes, this should have been a series or a trilogy, but instead, Disney just did a bunch of half-baked themes.

Unlike a lot of people, I did like the dwarves (I actually think they were the best part of the movie). They were pretty close to the classic.

Unfortunately, with these live action movies, the animals cannot have the rich facial expressions that you can see in the animated versions, so there were parts of this movie that were set up for failure from the get go.

I did like the last 10 minutes of the movie, which is why I am giving it 2/5. It was the only time where we had **some** focus on a theme.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Snow White, who is supposed to be a symbol of innocence and kindness, comes across as uninspired and overly assertive in an attempt to redefine her character for a modern audience. The changes to beloved characters, like the dwarfs being reimagined into a group of actors without clear purpose, detract from the whimsy that made the original so timeless.

Furthermore, the movie’s pacing and overall plot are incoherent and uninspired, leading to a lack of emotional connection with the characters. The visuals, though grand and sweeping, feel hollow without a compelling narrative to anchor them. There is an overwhelming sense that the film tries to preach messages of empowerment and independence, but it comes across as heavy-handed and preachy rather than organically integrated into the story. Rather than feeling like an exciting retelling of a cherished fairy tale, the film often feels like a mishmash of ideas that don’t quite fit together, leaving it ultimately unsatisfying for both long-time fans and new viewers.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

One of the key aspects of the original tale is Snow White’s look, described as having “skin as white as snow.” While the actress in this version is truly beautiful and talented, the casting didn’t quite align with the traditional imagery of the character, which made the story feel a bit disconnected from its roots.

The portrayal of the Evil Queen also felt off. She came across as more glamorous than menacing, which weakened the contrast between her and Snow White something that plays a big role in the original story.

Another major shift was the removal of classic elements, like the prince’s kiss breaking the spell, and the addition of new songs and story changes. While updating a story can bring fresh perspectives, these changes felt too far removed from the original, and as a result, the film lost some of the magic and charm we had hoped for.

Visually, the effects didn’t quite meet the standard we expected either. The animation felt a bit too cartoonish, and didn’t blend well with the live-action elements. With today’s technology, we hoped for something more immersive and realistic.

In the end, we left the theater early because it just didn’t feel like the Snow White we know and love. I do believe the cast has talent and potential—especially the lead, who might be a great fit for a different kind of role but this version of the story just didn’t resonate with us.

Just like all the other Snow White movies live-action, they pick the wrong Snow White to act with the Evil queen. Strong female actress with a no-name or fairly new upcoming actress? Not a great pairing. For this 2025 version, a Snow White actress wouldv'e been better off to pair Vanessa Hudgens, Jenna Ortega, or even Zendaya Coleman.

Another bit of a downer, the 7 drawfs? Too AI cartoon. The animals and scenes AI wasn't bad but the beginning was cartoon then live action, play-like and AI. Pick a media feature and stick with it.

Costumes for town folk, Snow White, and the Queen not great - only thing fitting was the Evil Queen's crown, nails and jewelry but the fabric choices not tasteful. 

The dancing they had the Evil Queen do made her look spastic in some of the moves.

The movie did not keep my attention like other live-action Disney. Very disappointed.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

1. The Story Felt Hollow
They tried to change things up, but instead of improving the plot, they just made it worse. The charm and heart of the original were gone, and what replaced it felt forced and awkward. It didn’t feel like Snow White anymore — just a random fantasy movie trying too hard to be deep.

2. The Acting Was... Rough
I’m not trying to be harsh, but the acting really took me out of it. Snow White’s performance felt stiff and unnatural, and the chemistry between characters was almost nonexistent. It’s hard to connect with a story when the people in it seem disconnected themselves.

3. The Forced Messaging
Look, I get that movies often have themes and messages — and that’s fine — but this one just shoved its ideas down your throat. It felt more like a lecture than a fairytale, and honestly, that’s not what I came to watch.

4. The Visuals Were Disappointing
For a Disney remake, I expected something stunning — but nope. The CGI felt cheap, the costumes looked off, and the whole thing lacked the magic that makes Snow White special.

Final Thoughts:
I gave it 1 star because it just didn’t work. The acting, the changes to the story, the weird messaging — it all felt forced and awkward. I wanted a fun, magical experience, but instead, I left the theater frustrated and disappointed.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

Rachel Zegler as Snow White? A total trainwreck. Her voice is so shrill I thought my eardrums were going to explode—every time she sang “Waiting on a Wish,” I wanted to throw my soda at the screen. She’s trying to be this “empowered leader” Snow White, but she comes off as a whiny brat who doesn’t know what she’s doing. Her acting is so stiff I thought she was a cardboard cutout, and her “sweet” vibe feels so fake I gagged. 0/10, Rachel stick to TikTok, because you ruined this role.

This remake is a soulless cash grab that spits on the 1937 classic, and Rachel Zegler’s awful performance is the nail in the coffin. 1 star, and that’s me being generous.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White, while vocally capable, feels miscast, lacking the inherent charm and innocence that defined the original character. The attempt to modernize her falls flat, resulting in a character that feels less like a fairy tale heroine and more like a generic, modern trope.

Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, while visually striking, descends into campy caricature. Her performance, while occasionally entertaining, lacks the genuine menace and regal presence that made the original queen so iconic. The dynamic between Snow White and the Queen feels forced and unconvincing, lacking the essential tension that drives the story.

The updated musical numbers are a cacophony of forgettable melodies and generic lyrics. They feel shoehorned into the narrative, disrupting the flow and failing to capture the magic of the original songs. The visuals, while technically proficient, are often garish and overwhelming, lacking the subtlety and artistry of classic animation.

The attempt at diversity feels tokenistic and forced, with the seven companions reduced to shallow stereotypes. Their inclusion feels less like a genuine attempt at representation and more like a checklist of modern buzzwords. The story itself feels disjointed and muddled, losing the essential simplicity and emotional resonance of the original.

This ""Snow White"" is a soulless, corporate product, stripped of its heart and magic. It's a cynical attempt to capitalize on nostalgia while delivering a watered-down, politically correct version of a beloved tale. It's a film that will leave audiences feeling disappointed and betrayed, a stark reminder of how far Hollywood has strayed from its roots.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

They should have found a lead actress who appreciated the original snow white and didn't hate on it every chance she got. I feel there was a way of making the original snow white modern without taking it this far. I also wish they added real dwarfs and gave more actors a chance at jobs since smaller people can't always find a place in movies. This would've been perfect for them! I just think the movie is corny and overall just bad. I wish the main actress didn't take it so personally but she just wasn't fit for this specific role. Lastly, the singing sounded nothing like snow white nor did the actress act like snow white. This was an aggressive feminist which snow white was far from. She was supposed to be gentle and calming. Disney, do better.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The special effects were essentially for the same reason as plot points and had a Disney theme which it needed to redo. The chase scene with the forest was way overdone and felt forced to the end. The very few creatures didn't feel real or had no 'life' in the forest or really anywhere. 

In the the plot it started somewhere and got lost trying to introduce a prince that wasn't a prince. I couldn't care about the guy thieving around and liked him even less after the fact. Afterwards failed to difference the queen until the very end where they magically show an underground chamber that existed before ( no clue but it was only referenced like 3 times for plot, basically queen got magic but won't ever use it??). 

Overall 6/10 for arts and some bits but was far over rushed and failed to seemingly make itself known. Wait for it on Disney Plus and watch as a slow night movie.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The casting just didn’t feel right. Snow White didn’t really capture the sweetness or magic the character is supposed to have. And instead of the beloved dwarves, they gave us random characters that didn’t feel special or memorable at all. Why change something so iconic without a good reason?

The sets looked super fake too, like something out of a TV show for kids, not a beautiful Disney fairy tale. It reminded me more of Descendants than a true Disney princess movie, which is not what I was hoping for at all.

I understand that they were trying to make it more modern and diverse, and I really appreciate that effort in general—but this just didn’t work. The heart of the story felt lost, and everything seemed rushed or awkward.

In the end, it didn’t feel magical, it didn’t feel like Snow White, and I honestly wouldn’t watch it again. Even my kids got bored halfway through. Disney can do so much better than this.

Moreover through a rabid commitment to an entirely irrational gender ideology which they've convinced themselves is morally righteous they've allowed predatory men to encroach upon women's spaces all around the world and openly engage in child grooming in public.

They champion diversity but they don't like diversity of ideas. They champion Liberty, but they don't like freedom of speech. They preach about social justice on a phone made by a child slave. They use the expression ""Words have consequences"" entirely oblivious to how Fascistic that sounds. In short they're hypocrites of the highest order. They are all of those things they claimed to hate the most. Bigots, Authoritarians and Bullies.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Go on Netflix and look up Canadian movies and television that is far superior to this garbage.  In fact, look up Canadian bands and listen to music that is far superior to the discordant failure of a soundtrack this movie has.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

While the film’s visuals are polished, its casting choices and lack of genuine charm make it a disappointing watch.  

However, the most egregious flaw is Disney’s decision to cast an IDF soldier in a prominent role. Given the ongoing atrocities committed by the IDF in Palestine, this casting is not just tone-deaf—it’s morally reprehensible. By platforming someone complicit in the oppression and violence against Palestinians, Disney sends a clear message about where its values lie: profit over basic human decency.  

Art does not exist in a vacuum, and entertainment companies have a responsibility to consider the ethical implications of their choices. Instead, Disney chose to ignore the suffering of millions, rewarding a representative of a violent occupation with a major Hollywood role.  

For this reason alone, Snow White deserves 1 star—not just for being a mediocre film, but for making a blatantly unethical casting decision that should outrage anyone who believes in justice. Avoid this movie and hold Disney accountable for its shameful support of oppression.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

I so miss seeing Femininity strength shine through in its softened, purity and kindness. Because not every women’s strength is in armor.. That’s what should have been portrayed through snow white in the first place…Let her be a damsel. And build her character off of what Disney had intended her to be when they made this movie in the 1930’s.

 It’s too late now, but maybe they’ll reconsider how they should be approaching their remakes in the coming future.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

The film also failed to capture the charm and heart of the original Snow White. The story felt hollow, the characters lacked depth, and the overall execution was disappointing. Even the musical numbers, which should have been a highlight, felt forced and forgettable. Instead of delivering a visually stunning and emotionally engaging experience, this movie felt like a lazy attempt to cash in on nostalgia without any real effort.

It’s frustrating to see Disney continuously remake their classics with such little care. This film had the potential to be something special, but instead, it turned into a soulless mess with bad CGI, unconvincing performances, and unnecessary changes that added nothing of value. If you’re a fan of the original, save yourself the disappointment—this one isn’t worth your time or money.","You and 10 other people found this helpful.","10 people found this helpful."

Snow White's character hardly resembled the sweet and endearing figure we've come to adore; instead, she came across as dull and unrelatable.

Overall, this adaptation of ""Snow White"" felt like a missed opportunity to breathe new life into a timeless tale. It lacked the magic, emotion, and whimsy that have made Snow White's story an enduring favorite across generations.

Disney’s Snow White (2025) is a steaming pile of corporate garbage. It’s not just bad…it’s aggressively, insultingly bad. The entire movie feels like it was made by a committee of clueless executives who had no idea what the hell they wanted. The tone is a chaotic mess, the acting is embarrassing, and the CGI dwarves look like cursed video game NPCs.

Rachel Zegler tries to play a classic Disney princess but is stuck delivering cringe-worthy, forced “girlboss” dialogue that sounds like it was ripped from a 2015 Twitter thread. Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen is a joke-she’s stiff as hell and spends half the movie looking like she’s in a Spirit Halloween costume. And don’t even get me started on Jonathan (who the fuck asked for him?), an annoying, quippy idiot who feels like he wandered in from a rejected Frozen sequel.

Visually, this thing is an embarrassment. The costumes look cheap, the CGI is laughably bad, and that stupid “Fearless, Fair, Brave, True” necklace looks like something you’d find in a dollar store bargain bin. It’s a soulless, ugly, uninspired trainwreck.

The action scenes were so poorly choreographed that it felt like watching toddlers play-fight in slow motion.

I kept hoping the movie would redeem itself, but it only got worse. The pacing was atrocious, the twists were painfully predictable, and the ending was so stupid it actually made me angry.

Gone is the innocent, gentle Snow White; in her place is a character seemingly designed to alienate anyone who dares to enjoy a classic fairy tale.","You and 12 other people found this helpful.","12 people found this helpful."

#3- The movies costumes were so bad they looked like cheap temu party city outfits, and my question is why ? With a budget of over 200Mil, couldn't they hire a good stylist ? 

The actual best part of the movie was Rachel Zegler, she is a young beautiful and talented girl with a wonderful voice, who was unlucky enough to have a terrible stylist and make up artist. 

The casting, the cinematography, the production was all really bad, almost as if it was intentional. There's no way DISNEY agreed to do this and witnessed the final result and thought it would succeed. Doomed from the start. 

Overall my heart goes out to Rachel Z who is the face of the film, and had to endure harsh criticisms for things she had no control over. 

The evil queen as a bad Vegas drag queen is something I wont forgive Disney for. 

It makes me appreciate a film like Snow White and the Huntsman, and in a world where Kristen Stewart is a better Snow White than this .. well that tells you all you need to know. The consumes, the casting ALL TOP NOTCH ! Oh and I need a rewatch of ONCE UPON  A TIME to wash off the taste of this off my mouth and remind myself there are worthy productions out there deserving praise. 

Final Grade F+ Sorry, not sorry.

Rachel Zegler is talented, but in this? She looked like she didn’t even want to be there. And honestly? I didn’t blame her. Her version of Snow White barely even smiles, has zero chemistry with anyone, and somehow manages to make every line sound like a TED Talk on why fairy tales are bad. Girl, just sing to the birds or something, please.

And the dwarfs… sorry, “magical companions” or whatever they’re calling them now? It was like Disney threw darts at a casting board and said, “Perfect. Now give them NO personality whatsoever.”

The movie tries to be deep and empowering, but it forgets to be fun. Like, I’m all for modern takes, but if you’re gonna ditch everything that made the original special, at least give us something cool in return. Better visuals? Nope. Great soundtrack? Nah. Even the villain was boring.

Overall, it felt like a parody of a Disney movie written by someone who lowkey hates Disney movies.

Disney's latest attempt to ""reimagine"" a classic fairy tale, ""Snow White,"" is an unmitigated disaster. This live-action adaptation lacks the charm, magic, and artistry of the original, instead offering a visually bland and narratively lifeless experience.

The CGI, frankly, is appalling. The dwarves, in particular, look like uncanny valley creations, their movements stiff and their expressions wooden. The vibrant colors and fantastical creatures of the original are replaced with a drab, muted palette that saps the film of any visual vitality.

The acting is uniformly mediocre. The titular Snow White, while undeniably beautiful, delivers a performance that is flat and devoid of any genuine emotion. The supporting cast fares little better, with many characters feeling like caricatures rather than fully realized individuals.

Beyond the technical shortcomings, ""Snow White"" is plagued by a sense of self-importance and a misguided attempt to address modern social issues. The film's feminist leanings feel forced and preachy, ultimately undermining the story's inherent magic and wonder.

Verdict: ""Snow White"" is a soulless, CGI-laden mess that disrespects the source material and fails to entertain. Avoid at all costs.","You and 12 other people found this helpful.","12 people found this helpful."

Visually, while some scenes were stunning, others felt overly reliant on CGI, sacrificing authenticity for spectacle. The dwarfs, instead of providing comic relief and warmth, came off as caricatures rather than fully realized characters.

Overall, the movie missed the mark in honoring the beloved classic. It felt more like a cash grab than a heartfelt tribute. I left the theatre disappointed and wishing for the magic of Disney's original Snow White.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

As for the evil queen, the performance was not my favorite. The accent felt a bit overdone, which took away from the character's impact. Additionally, I really believe that the dwarfs should have been portrayed by little people rather than using CGI. I think this role could have been a great opportunity for talented actors in that community.

From the moment this project was announced, it was clear that Disney had no interest in respecting the original. The heartwarming fairytale romance? Gone. The iconic characters? Completely changed beyond recognition. The whimsy and magic that made Snow White such a beloved classic? Nowhere to be found. Instead, what we get is a reimagining that strips away everything that made the story special in the first place.

The film feels like it’s trying too hard to be something it’s not, and in doing so, it loses all sense of identity. The writing is bland, the changes feel forced, and there’s a noticeable lack of heart throughout the entire runtime. It doesn’t feel like a passion project—it feels like a studio checking off a list of what they think a “modern” audience wants, without ever stopping to consider why people loved the original in the first place.

Disney has completely lost sight of what made their animated classics so magical. If they can’t commit to actually honoring these stories instead of tearing them apart and rebuilding them into something unrecognizable, then maybe it’s time to stop remaking them altogether.

And honesty think he would, make a good choice of character, for Disney Tangled Flyn Rider character. Ending was different from original but was a nice twist. 
Would recommend it definitely watchable.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

I get wanting to update a classic, but some of the changes made it feel disconnected from the original charm.

Visually, it had some great moments—Disney knows how to make things look magical—but the heart of Snow White was missing. The story felt a bit forced, and instead of drawing me in emotionally, it kept reminding me that it was a ""modern reimagining.""

And honestly? All the off-screen drama surrounding the film kind of overshadowed the actual experience. Whether it was Zegler’s comments, the backlash, or the debates about what Snow White ""should"" be, it was hard to separate the movie from the controversy.

At the end of the day, it’s not the worst Disney remake, but it’s also not one I’d rush to rewatch. If you love Snow White, you might be disappointed. If you’re just looking for a decent fantasy movie, it’s… okay.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Her strength is amazing as she does things not as a princess, but as a strong and independent women. I would call this movie a strong and independent film, breaking down the walls of the original story and building it's own story from the bits and pieces it destroyed. It would take such strength and independence to stand up to those who loved the original and tell them to be quite. This isn't a love story. This is about strength and independence. She doesn't need a prince to make her a princess. She doesn't need love. She is strong and independent. If they make a snow white 2, I think they should make her even stronger and even more independent. I would cut all the scenes out that included a prince. I would have Snow white be the owner of a mining company that employs dwarves to mine diamonds for her and demand they whistle whilst they work the mine.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The pacing was uneven, leaving key moments feeling rushed while other scenes dragged on without purpose.

As for Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen, her performance, while visually striking, lacked the menacing gravitas and complexity the role demands. Her delivery often felt flat, missing the cunning, jealousy, and desperation that make the Evil Queen such a compelling antagonist. While Gadot has proven her talent in other roles, this performance felt miscast, as she didn’t fully embody the dark, regal intensity required for the character.

Overall, the movie failed to capture the magic of the original tale, and Gal Gadot’s performance, while not without its moments, didn’t elevate the material as one might have hoped. It’s a disappointing effort that leaves much to be desired.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

Jonathan wasn't even a proper prince. The guy who was in jail with him was the real hero. If not for him going against the Queen's orders, Snow Brown wouldn't even be ALIVE!

""she's only half white, how annoying"". That is racism, actual passionate racism. Animated dwarves aren't woke, supporting Palestinians isn't woke (that's not controversial, IDF dropped bombs on kids), this is about race and the conversation over this movie has been that way for years, and making it about anti-wokeness is just a convenient (and temporary) veil. Feeding into it is racist, and spineless. It's an American film, not a white film, and she's white anyway so this all really stupid, just like the very, very, very dumb, middle school-minded, adult men crying and acting like Snow White is their story (for the whites) and it's being stolen by this (half-white) American actress who supports Palestinians (again, bombs were dropped on kids, guess who's not winning that argument).

I liked the Dwarves and the ""prince"" storylines. The ending isn't very strong though. Does not feel woke or like theyre trying to force a political message.

For all the haters & Review Bombers: Get a Life. Stop review bombing with 1 Star. I have actually watched Snow White (2025) and find it very compelling and morally superior to the 1937 version. At Disney Premier of Snow White (2025), I saw girls from all different background dressed as Snow White. So, why can't their role model come from any background as well? Only a morally corrupt heart would teach little girls from diverse background that some can be Snow White while others cannot.

So, when I learned about the live-action adaptation of Snow White, I was filled with anticipation and excitement. I hoped it would capture the magic and charm of the original animated film. Unfortunately, my experience was quite the opposite, as I found the adaptation deeply disappointing.

The story felt distorted from the beginning, far from the beloved narrative that defined my childhood. I couldn't help but question why the filmmakers needed to make significant changes to a timeless classic. The alterations seemed unnecessary and left me puzzled, as they stripped away much of the essence that made the original so special.

Moreover, the casting choices did not resonate with me at all. Instead of embracing the characters I grew to love, the portrayals felt disconnected, making it difficult for me to form a bond with them. This lack of connection only deepened my disappointment as I longed for the enchantment I had experienced as a child.

Overall, the live-action adaptation of Snow White did not provide the magical experience I had hoped for, leaving me feeling let down by an opportunity to rekindle a cherished part of my childhood.","You and 15 other people found this helpful.","15 people found this helpful."

The attempt at modernizing the narrative with a focus on female empowerment feels forced and lacks genuine emotional depth.  The absence of romantic passion and a diluted focus on the core themes of the original tale further contribute to its shortcomings. 

 Finally, the reported behavior of Rachel Zegler, while not directly reflected in the film itself, casts a negative shadow on the production.  Disney's involvement in these creative choices is a cause for concern, and raises fears for future adaptations, particularly of beloved classics like Rapunzel. 

 A more faithful and nuanced approach to these cherished stories is desperately needed.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Also,  if it is okay to change the race, ethnicity, etc if the characters in a classic Germanic tale like Snow White. It needs to be ok to change the race, ethnicity, etc in the characters from classic stories of other races that are non-white. If it isn't acceptable and is considered racially offensive to make a live action of say...The princess and the frog where the princess's character is traditional a black princess. Why should it be acceptable to have a different race play a white princess? Would it be okay for Disney to make a live-action Coco about a traditional Latin American tail using White actors as the main characters? No, it would not be acceptable and people would be up in arms about it. It's only ok if, this is done to white characters from traditional white stories. Any other way would be blasphemy!!!

The dwarves are horrifying, the backgrounds suck, and the animals look like they were pulled out of an ai art prompt from how shiny and unreal they look.

All in all, this is another flop on disnys end. They should take a break from making shitty content and look at the feedback of ""fans"" (if there are any left), who are basically screaming that they do NOT want another half-assed live action fairy tail movie.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Gal Gadot is as beautiful as she is untalented. She was decent in Wonder Woman 2017 but she really cannot act.  

Zegler will struggle to find roles after this debacle. Not because of talent (because she can actually sing) but the baggage and this albatross of a stain. 

The plot of this movie is easily 45 minutes longer than it really needs to be. This could have been a 90 minute in and out, but it just drags on and on and on!! So many unneeded plot lines and story that doesn’t make any sense. 

Seeing this movies rating of 1.4 brings me comfort because it tells me that the world is healing.

If the goal was to create an empowered heroine in a fresh, modern fantasy setting, they could’ve built an entirely new tale around that concept — new characters, a new world, a new legend.

Instead, they leaned on the Snow White name to cash in on nostalgia, while simultaneously dismantling everything that made the original resonate with audiences in the first place. The result? Neither a faithful remake nor an original story, leaving both classic fans and modern audiences dissatisfied.

It’s like they wanted the marketing power of the old title without respecting the source material — and ended up with a product that feels hollow. Imagine how much stronger the movie could have been if they’d committed to making something truly new, rather than dressing a completely different story in Snow White's skin.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

She didn’t embody the charm and purity that made the character timeless — instead, she felt like a caricature of what people think a “strong” woman should be, without any of the warmth or empathy that Snow White should have.

Even worse, the movie felt more like a political agenda than a fairy tale. The entire plot was drenched in messaging that was entirely out of place for a children’s movie. Instead of focusing on the magic, adventure, and moral lessons, we got a story bogged down with unnecessary modern-day politics and virtue-signaling. It was as if the intentions of Snow White cared more about pushing their own ideals than telling a story that could captivate young minds.

This wasn’t a movie for kids — it was a thinly-veiled attempt to push a certain narrative, and it completely overshadowed the joy and timeless appeal of the original Snow White. What a missed opportunity to honor a classic. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

okay. okay. i’m breathing. deep breath in. exhale. namaste.

this movie—this movie—starts with gordon ramsay (yes. that gordon ramsay) being flung out of a medieval pot roast catapult into a dimension where food is LITERALLY magic and somehow there’s a spatula named Whiskers that knows Latin?? i watched this stone-cold sober and still felt like i hallucinated a scene where he challenges a troll to a bake-off while “eye of the tiger” plays on a lute. i am begging for answers.

the film is visually deranged in the most deliciously 1985 way. fog machines are working overtime. glitter is everywhere. the lighting is exclusively purple and fire. it’s giving Xanadu meets Top Chef meets The Dark Crystal and i did not come emotionally prepared for that.

ramsay? acting? look. the man yells at a fire demon for overcooking risotto and i believed every second of it. he’s weirdly magnetic. but also? absolutely terrifying. i would not want him anywhere near my enchanted casserole.

vanessa redgrave shows up halfway through as some kind of time-traveling spice witch and delivers a monologue about nutmeg that made me cry. made me cry. this film should be studied in film school and also possibly banned.

also. why is the final battle scored with a synth rendition of “be our guest.” did disney sue? did anyone sue? did anyone read the script???

in conclusion: i did not like this movie. i did not understand this movie. i do not think this movie likes me. and yet i will be watching it again tonight with a bottle of wine and a grilled cheese because i am a woman of complicated taste.

Rachel Zegler, unfortunately, doesn’t help. Her performance feels disinterested, but worse is the off-screen baggage—her pre-release comments criticizing the original film and expressing disdain for its themes alienated longtime fans and overshadowed the release.

Visually, the film is uninspired. The CGI dwarfs look more like placeholders than characters, and Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen swings unevenly between flat and cartoonish. The new songs lack punch, and the film’s heavy-handed social updates feel more like corporate posturing than thoughtful storytelling.

Not only that, but you took the original story about a beautiful, gentle, and innocent young girl with fair skin ""as white as snow,"" lips ""as red as blood,"" and hair ""as black as ebony."" who falls in love with her prince, and decided to rewrite her as not only brown but ""independent,"" ending up with a thief instead of a prince.  

Why are you portraying femininity as something bad? What’s wrong with being soft, sweet, and rescued by a prince? Not all women want to be leaders or CEOs. Stop pushing your agenda onto every character.  

You already have plenty of ""girlboss"" characters Mulan, Tiana, Rapunzel, Elsa, Merida, Snow White didn’t need to become one of them!  

This movie deserves a zero, but since one is the lowest rating, take it.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

It’s less of a reimagining and more of a tone-deaf, soulless rewrite that strips away everything that made the original story iconic. What we’re left with is a confused, preachy, and joyless film that doesn’t seem to know who it’s for.

The lead performance is painfully flat. There’s no charisma, no emotional depth, and absolutely no reason to root for her. Snow White is supposed to be kind, brave, and inspiring—but here, she comes off as smug and strangely detached. The script gives her nothing to work with, and even less for the audience to care about.

The visuals range from bland to outright ugly. Overused CGI, lifeless set design, and a total lack of magic or wonder. The classic fairy tale charm? Gone. The supporting cast? Forgettable at best, cringeworthy at worst.

What’s most frustrating is how the film tries so hard to be ""modern"" that it forgets to be good. It talks down to the audience instead of telling a meaningful story, and ends up feeling more like a lecture than a movie. Disney has officially lost the plot with this one.

1/5 stars—and that’s generous.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

The way she presents herself and what a nasty attitude she has.  Not to mention she doesn’t look like a Snow White at all. If the directors wanted to make a Latina princess with a feminist storyline, they should have just made their own movie rather than create a shitty remake of a classic.

-The part where the evil queen was singing, I mean I know they did their best to make Gal’s voice improved but I don’t think the song fits her or better yet singing is not for her. They could have hired a singer and have her lip sync the song. 

-The obviousness of the CGI of the dwarves are over the top! I would love to see dwarves from The Lord of The Rings or The Hobbit kind of animation or whatever. 
 
- They really eliminated the prince character and gave us a bandit instead.

- The confrontation of Snow and the evil queen was really off and Gal and Rachel’s acting were not giving!!! AT ALL

- The evil quest had like 3-4 different outfits but Snow had only two and both are ugly! 

- We got robbed big time with the scene where the iconic transformation of the evil queen to an old hag. The animated one was nicely done than the live action. 

- Gal’s acting as a villain is not giving! She can’t sit with the same table as Maleficent and Lady Tremain 

- The death scene of the evil queen is not even memorable. 

- The costumes are too obvious specially the white ones at the end.

The odd, creepy animation of the dwarfs was off putting. The music was terrible. The only song that I almost liked was Whistle while you work. 

The story line was drastically changed from the original movie. That in itself was not so bothersome but they took almost every aspect of the original storyline that made it endearing and butchered it. I would have been ok with updating the story but completely scrapping the original and  rewriting to the point it’s almost unwatchable is wrong.

One last point and I’ve done. In what world Would Rachel Ziegler be fairer or more beautiful than Gal Gadot! Even in Hollywood, That is too much of a stretch. However both actresses did well. I understand that Rachel screwed the pooch during movie press tour. That is on her. However I do feel that she was set up for failure with everything from the storyline butchery and the unfortunate Lord Farquhar hair style. 

Even with all of its faults I think a well done Snow White movie would be worth watching.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Zegler’s portrayal of Snow White lacks the warmth, grace, and innocence that made the original character so iconic. Instead, she delivers her lines with a flatness that feels disconnected and at times even condescending to the source material. Her take on the role feels more like a modern lecture than a timeless fairytale heroine.

The script was drenched in woke messaging that felt completely out of place. It’s one thing to evolve characters for a new generation, but this just felt like a total rejection of what made the original beloved in the first place. Instead of whimsy and magic, we got preaching and politics.

The only saving grace of this movie was Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. She delivered the perfect balance of elegance and menace, and honestly, she looked like she was having fun with the role. Too bad she was stuck in a movie that didn’t deserve her.

On top of that, Zegler’s public comments dismissing the 1937 classic as “outdated” were disrespectful to the film that made this remake possible. It’s hard to root for a Snow White who seems to dislike the very story she’s in.

The film itself lacks the magic, charm, and heart of the original. Instead of being a timeless fairy tale, it feels like a forced, modernized version that strips away the essence of what made Snow White beloved for generations. The CGI dwarfs are an eyesore, the romance has been removed, and the overall execution is bland and forgettable.

Disney has once again proven that not every classic needs a remake—especially not one that insults its own legacy. Save your money and rewatch the original instead.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

   * Many reviews have described Gadot's performance as ""stilted,"" meaning it lacks naturalness and fluidity. This suggests a disconnect between the actress and the character, hindering the audience's ability to connect with the Evil Queen.
   * Critics have also labeled her performance ""ineffective,"" indicating that she fails to convey the necessary menace and power associated with the iconic villain.

 * Weak Vocal Performance:

   * Her singing voice has been described as ""thin,"" which is a significant drawback for a musical role. This suggests that she struggles to deliver the musical numbers with the necessary strength and emotional depth.

 * Lack of Impact:

   * Even with the elaborate costumes and special effects, Gadot's performance is said to have lacked impact. Critics have expressed that she did not bring the character to life in a believable or captivating way.

 * Material Limitations:

   * Some critics have stated that she was given weak material to work with. Meaning that the writing of the character, was not strong. This does not fully excuse the performance, but gives context to it.
In essence, the criticism points to a performance that is perceived as lacking in both emotional depth and vocal prowess, ultimately failing to deliver a compelling rendition of the Evil Queen.","You and 133 other people found this helpful.","133 people found this helpful."

Andrew’s handcuffs come off just by pulling the chains from the wall. I really wish they had made that scene more creative. How can chains be broken by just pulling it with human hands? 

Out of no where, one single snow flake falls from the sky, on her finger, and that makes her have a sudden epiphany to restore the kingdom. 

I personally think that “a hand meets a hand” scene was very cringe and unnatural. It sounded like a high school musical type of thing.

They portrayed dopey as a victim of bullying,  and a sad character, while the original dopey was accepted, playful and teased in a good way. Also dopey spoke in the live action movie. Dopey was no longer dopey in this movie. 

The last scene, where Snow White restores the kingdom by simply reminding everyone of their identities, lacked creativity. If dismantling the queen’s reign was that easy, it raises the question of why it wasn’t done earlier.

And her offscreen vibe? Even worse. Trashing the original story as “creepy” and rolling her eyes at the romance? Girl, you signed up to play *Snow White*. If you’re embarrassed by the source material, why take the job? It made the whole movie feel like a cynical cash grab, not a love letter to the classic.  

Sure, the movie’s dumpster-fire script and those weird CGI “dwarves” didn’t help, but Zegler’s take was the final nail in the coffin. She turned Snow White into a poster child for Hollywood’s “fix what ain’t broken” obsession. The magic died the second she smirked at the camera like she was too cool for the story.  

Zegler’s Snow White wasn’t just bad—it felt like a middle finger to fans. The movie failed because it forgot why we loved the original, and she’s the face of that disconnect.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

It honestly feels like modern Disney HATES all the hard work and effort that was put in at the beginning so they could become what they are today — and Snow White is the proof of that. It was the very first Disney movie, the one that turned them into the giant company they are now, and they completely disregarded that legacy. They ruined the script, the characters, and the very essence of Disney. How is it possible that they couldn’t even stick to something as basic as the idea of true love, which was such a huge part of those classic stories? What they should’ve done was create a sweet, heartwarming story like the original — not destroy it with these ""woke"" ideas. What’s this nonsense about a feminist Snow White? We all know that in the classic, that was never the case. How can she say the prince wasn’t important when the entire happy ending literally depended on him?

Why are they so obsessed with forcing these ""woke"" ideas into something where it’s simply NOT NECESSARY? Honestly, current Disney is a disaster. It’s embarrassing to see the absolute lack of creative and intellectual capacity of the directors and people in charge, who are clearly running everything into the ground with this forced inclusivity. It’s heartbreaking to think about what Mr. Walt Disney would feel, seeing how they’ve destroyed the company he built with so much effort, imagination, and love. They should be ashamed. It was never just about the money — it was about the magic and dreams of millions of people who grew up with these characters.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

It’s clear she thought she was above the material, and it shows in her performance. Instead of embodying the beloved princess, she came off as smug and unlikeable.

The film itself might have had some redeeming qualities—decent visuals, passable supporting cast—but when your lead actress is this bad, nothing can save it.

Rather than letting the film speak for itself, Zegler seemed more interested in rewriting the character into something entirely different, making it clear that this wasn’t a movie for fans of the original but rather a statement piece. While adaptations should evolve, there’s a fine line between refreshing a classic and outright rejecting its core essence. Unfortunately, Snow White falls into the latter, leaving audiences with a film overshadowed by unnecessary controversy instead of timeless storytelling.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

The 'updated' characterizations were baffling. Snow White, instead of being a character with inner strength, was reduced to a one-dimensional, perpetually angry figure.

She was so cartoonishly villainous, it was laughable.
The visuals, which should have been a saving grace, were a chaotic blend of CGI that looked unfinished and sets that felt cheap and artificial. The musical numbers, instead of being enchanting, were jarring and forgettable. The dialogue was clunky and preachy, clearly designed to hit certain talking points rather than tell a compelling story.
The supposed 'modernization' felt forced and inauthentic. It seemed as though the filmmakers were so concerned with ticking off boxes that they forgot to create a cohesive and enjoyable film.

Even Gal Gadot, who I thought would at least make a great Evil Queen, was underwhelming. The performances overall were just dull, and the chemistry between the characters was nonexistent.

And don’t get me started on the visuals. The CGI looked awkward, especially with the seven dwarfs—if you can even call them that anymore. It was distracting and took away from the fairy-tale feel. The pacing was also terrible; some scenes dragged on forever, while others felt rushed and incomplete.

Overall, this remake wasn’t worth my time.

There was a much better storyline developed in this version than the original. It also really developed the characters of Snow White and the ""prince"" who was actually more of a ""Robin Hood"" character than a prince.

Snow White was the first princess movie I watched as a kid, so the story holds a special place in my heart as it does most people. I knew this movie was going to miss the mark by the first advertisement I saw, but I was holding out hope they would somehow pull it together with a great script/soundtrack.

Firstly, CGI in this film is a no for me. What is the point of making a live action if everything down to the dress looks animated. I dont mind the costuming and l characters (dwarfs) mimicking cartoons, but disney might have the worst approach to bringing to life these elements nowadays. It comes off as creepy in scenes. 

Secondly, this movie had the worst soundtrack i have ever heard. Songs sound AI generated for real. Script is really very boring as well, i was waiting for a twist or something. Nothing happened. With the budget this movie had, actually why was it so so bad.

Rachel’s performance was good for what she was given to work with, but i can understand why she did not want to do this movie at all. They gave her the worst bob ever and a crap script and said “now be snow white”. I hope disney either stops producing live actions or gets better producers to do them in the future because this truly was not good.

A great children’s watch, but by far worst live action to date.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Snow White looked like she wandered onto the set by accident.

The whole thing felt like a fever dream where the fairest of them all just gave up halfway through getting ready.

By the end, my daughter was sobbing—not because of the Evil Queen, but because she felt personally betrayed. We came for Disney magic, but we left with a lesson in disappointment and questionable costume design.

Each song blurs into the next, offering no variety or memorable moments—leaving the soundtrack as a monotonous and forgettable experience.

The acting fails to bring any real emotion or depth to the characters, and the visuals—far from the vibrant standard expected from a Disney-affiliated project—come across as cheap and uninspired, more like an off-Broadway imitation than a polished theatrical performance.

What’s most disheartening is the missed opportunity to inspire a sense of wonder in younger audiences.

I loved the musical numbers and the casting was so spot on; I was reminded of the original, but this version built on the wonder of that perfect animation and made something new and just as special.

Sadly, this version of Snow White didn’t quite carry the grace that the character is known for. Her makeup and hairstyle felt mismatched, which made it harder to see her as the Snow White we all remember.

The Queen’s portrayal was also quite unusual. Instead of being commanding or subtly sinister, some scenes — especially the dancing parts — felt overly exaggerated, almost turning into awkward comedy. It took away from the intensity and presence the Queen should have had.

Overall, this version struggled to capture the charm and magic of the original. It’s always interesting to see new interpretations, but this one missed the emotional connection and elegance that make Snow White such a timeless classic.","You and 13 other people found this helpful.","13 people found this helpful."

Her rendition of ""Waiting on a Wish"" is simply beautiful, and her acting is truly remarkable. While the CGI is decent, it doesn’t take away from the overall enjoyment of the film. The negative criticism feels entirely forced, as it seems some people just love to hate on anything that’s fun or different.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

To begin, last night I went to my local cinema and saw Snow White with my 2 daughters and was utterly disappointed with this movie. It was a bunch of BALONEY!  Before I went and watched the movie, I obviously updated myself with the temperature of cast and fans, and I stumbled upon videos of this Rachel Zeeper ( Snow White ) and was in shock and awe. I could tell she would not like us Spinach’s and clearly attempted to stop us from watching it. However, through Spinach history, we have never backed down and persevered through. Watching the movie itself was an utter mess, the only good thing about the experience itself was that the theater was empty so Mr. Spinach here could kick up his ol’ feet. While watching the movie I realized the horrors were actually a reality. The acting itself was worse than any movie I have seen before. How does a billion dollar company like Disney hire Rachel Zeeper as their lead!? Either way we carried through the horrendous acting and monotone singing throughout the movie. I will say the only thing I did enjoy during this movie were the 7 Dwarves. To those who may not know the 7 Dwarves are looked down upon in Snow Whites story and as a Spinach I understand it. Spinach’s are used to being the “ little guy “, but throughout the story they showed tenacity to being the heroes! However, during the climax of the movie Snow White says “ I just want to free my people “ and during that monologue with the evil queen, my daughters turn to me and say “ Daddy, do you think Rachel Zeeper would save and free us even though we are Spinach’s “. I didn’t have the heart to tell them, but the truth is important to the Spinach’s so I softly said “ No honey. Rachel Zeeper hates us “. To then the onslaught of tears came down my daughters face. It is so disheartening to watch a movie with a character my daughters look up to, just for the main actress to hate people like the Spinach’s. Now people may say it is harsh, but Spinach’s are not liars and I will not defend Rachel Zeeper! I hope this review is a warning to all families like the Spinach’s and would totally recommend to NOT watch it. Thank you. This was Jeffrey Spinach.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

The performances feel phoned-in, not helped by a script that tries way too hard to be modern and self-aware, completely missing the timeless essence that made the original so beloved. There’s no emotional core, no character development, and worst of all—no joy.

If you were hoping for a nostalgic reimagining, look elsewhere. This isn’t a reimagining—it’s a hollow shell wearing the name Snow White.

I don’t like how this remake changes her iconic appearance, uses terrible CGI for the dwarfs, and shifts the message with comments that dismiss the classic tale.

This is just a ridiculous way to enact DEI. And Americans, both white or non white, are simply not going for it as you can see from the reviews. This may end Rachel Ziegler's career. I hope thats not the case but she's way too difficult to work with that company's may not want to hire her","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Mimikyu had mixed feelings, torn between the visuals and the weird tone shifts. Amy and Tails tried to stay optimistic, just rolling with it, but even they looked kinda blank by the end. Sweet, our movie historian of sorts, felt it was a disservice to the 1937 masterpiece and that says a lot. This one lacked charm, warmth, and real storytelling. Not our cup of tea.

1/10 – Watch the original instead.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

If you're looking for a film that will make you question the very nature of storytelling, congratulations, you've found it.
Here's a breakdown of the sheer, unadulterated awfulness:
 * The Casting:
   * It's like they held auditions at a fever dream. The performances were so wooden, I've seen more emotion from a plank of plywood.
   * The choices made, completely missed the mark, and had many viewers questioning the directors vision.
 * The Music:
   * Oh, the music. Where do I even begin? It was a cacophony of auto-tuned screeching and generic pop ballads that had absolutely no place in a fairy tale.
   * It felt as if the musical numbers were randomly inserted, with no connection to the story.
 * The CGI:
   * ""CGI"" is a generous term. It looked like a PlayStation 2 cutscene from 2003. The digital effects were so jarring, they pulled you out of the already flimsy narrative.
   * Especially the animals, those where down right nightmare inducing.
 * Everything Else:
   * The script? A jumbled mess of half-baked ideas and clichéd dialogue.
   * The pacing? Erratic. One minute, we're in a slow-motion forest chase, the next, we're in a jarringly fast musical number.
   * The attempts to modernize the story, where so ham fisted, it was insulting.
In short, ""Snow White"" (2025) is a cinematic abomination. Avoid it like the poisoned apple.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

I was genuinely excited to relive the classic, but the constant rewriting of scenarios made it feel like a completely different film. I get that they wanted to give it a 21st-century twist, but let’s be real—this story doesn’t take place in the future, it’s set in a fairytale world from a completely different era.

And the songs—so many songs. If they wanted to make it a musical, they should’ve just marketed it as one. The excessive singing felt unnecessary and distracting.

In the end, the changes were so drastic that the heart of the original Snow White was lost. What was once a timeless fairytale has been watered down into something unrecognizable.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

The film is visually impressive in parts, but it lacks emotional warmth. The characters feel hollow, with Snow White coming across as oddly detached and unrelatable. The decision to heavily alter core elements of the original story — including the dwarfs and the classic themes of kindness and innocence — strips the narrative of its fairytale essence.

The dialogue is stiff, the pacing is uneven, and the attempt to modernize the tale feels forced rather than empowering. Worst of all, the magic is simply… gone. This version seems more concerned with making a statement than telling a story.

Hell they used AI to create them you would think they would at least get them close to the originals.

I took my 5 yr old granddaughter she enjoyed it. But for me I preferred the old Disney one , to me that was more magical.  But this one did capture some magic, such as when Dopey learnt to whistle then later talk, yes that was nice.  I felt some scenes were rushed. 
I don't think it will win any awards.

Instead of saying we're 'remarking' a film. Then changing everything. Why don't you just create something new.

You can't just take Snow White and think, ohh we'll cast a lady of colour for this... and what on earth happened to them 'dwarfs' 

Total train wreck of a movie. I'm gutted because i was looking forward to this when I heard it was being remade... 

What's next? 

Are you remaking Pocahontas and casting wesley snipes as John smith? Then adding a plot twist and she gets off with grandmother willow and identifies as a lesbian tree... the end

Come on Disney.

Stop making your films so political.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Unfortunately, even with these positives, I couldn’t stay interested. The movie failed to capture my attention or evoke any real emotions, and I ended up bored before I could finish watching it.

Rachel Zegler’s portrayal of Snow White lacks warmth and sincerity, and frankly, it’s hard to root for a lead actress who openly disrespected the source material. Her dismissive comments about the original story and Prince Charming only made it clearer that this film was never about celebrating Disney’s legacy—it was about tearing it down.

On top of that, the film strips away the classic fairy tale magic, replacing it with a hollow, politically correct version that no one asked for. The dwarfs? Gone. The romance? Scrapped. The whimsy and wonder that made Snow White a timeless tale? Completely erased in favor of lifeless messaging.

Disney had the perfect opportunity to bring this classic to life with respect and nostalgia, but instead, they delivered yet another soulless, preachy remake.

I gave two stars because I'm a Disney fan, but, out of respect for Disney's classic films, I can't do more.

The story and the uniqueness of every character, specifically the dwarves, is why this movie was in a class of its own, in my opinion.

Now, to make the dwarves CGI but everything else human form was a bad decision. Highly disappointed there. I get allowing room for extra dramatic scenes and facial play, but not a solid enough reason for the choice made. The acting was off in general. I don't care about who was chosen to play Snow. She does look like the original character anyway, but just about everyone's acting, except the ""prince"" and villagers, were off. Why wasn't he a Prince? We have the story of a thief among the commoners becaming a Prince, Aladdin. So not an original idea, which makes the change pointless for the franchise. Another poor choice made.

Why was the glass casket not present? Small things matter. 😂The was a dope scene. And the dwarves put their talents to work to show their love and admiration for Snow. The glass casket was important. 

Why did they have Dopey speak? 

For the ""voiceless"", literally and figuratively, Dopey was my favorite character because he was loud without a word. Purety at its finest. 

""If it's not broke, don't fix it""..... That's My overall take for this movie. I can keep going but I'm going to stop LOL.

Instead, we get creepy CGI “magical creatures” that look like they crawled out of a low-budget fantasy film. The prince isn't even a prince. He's barely even in the story because they wanted Snow White to be a full-on “girlboss"" or whatever.

Even the music took a hit. They replaced Someday My Prince Will Come with Waiting on a Wish, which is just... bland. The original had this dreamy, romantic magic, but now it’s like Disney is afraid of letting their princesses have love stories.

The romance in the movie is wooden, there is no chemistry between Snow and the bandit (who is so dull I can’t even remember his name). This romance is clearly drawing inspiration from Tangled, except the pacing and tension is all wrong. Although the main duet is not bad, it comes far too early.

The ending is dire, honestly woefully bad. Snow White is suddenly Paul Atreides recounting the lives of all her subjects. 

The colouring and filmography is too fake, a tad reminiscent of the Minecraft movie (from what one can see in the trailers). I don’t mind the choice to change the dwarves to mythical creatures, but the over filtering and garish colours cause them to loose all humanity and empathy.

Let me just say it—Gal Gadot carried this film. She was the only reason to sit through this mess. Every time she was on screen, she was electric. Powerful, stunning, completely commanding the role. She ate it up and left no crumbs.

And then… there was Snow White. My god, what a disaster. The lead actress was painfully bad. No charm, no presence, nothing. It was like watching a piece of cardboard try to act. She had one job—to be Snow White—and she failed miserably. Who the hell thought she was a good choice?

And don’t even get me started on the never-ending musical numbers. They just wouldn’t stop. It was like every five minutes, they were forcing another annoying song down our throats. None of them were memorable, none of them added anything to the story. It was just filler, and it made the whole movie feel even worse.

Now, I’ll give credit where it’s due—the cinematography was solid, the colors were beautiful, and the overall setup looked great. The direction wasn’t bad either. But none of that matters when your lead actress is awful and the movie is stuffed with unnecessary musicals.","You and 22 other people found this helpful.","22 people found this helpful."

The CGI of the dwarves was a little intense at first, but I grew to enjoy them. Especially Dopey and his relationship with Johnathan and Snow White. I rather enjoyed the art of the forest and its creatures. 

The issue I found was… Snow White wasn’t particularly convincing. There is very little growth, her kindness feels static. The film simply assumes you’ll love this naive girl. Personally, the Evil Queen and even Flynn Rider inspired Johnathan moved me much more.

It’s sadly a flatlined movie with about a hour of filler that has no useful plot or character growth.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

If the fucking story says SHE WAS WHITE AS SNOW THEN MADE HER FUCKING WHITE AS SNOW, NOT BROWN LIKE SHIT. Disney was my childhood but these new bullshits are making me change my opinion.

There is absolutely no buildup to the past versus the present, the backstory is rushed. There's no need to show the entire rest of her years, but the foundation was made weak.
The rest of the movie just... isn't exciting. It falls completely short. You can't shake Zelger's hate for the source material, her enthusiasm feels forced. The dwarves had good dialogue but the CGI was horribly out of place. They were actually my favorite parts, the rest is underwhelming. I did like the parts with the queen.

We've all seen this unoriginal film a million times before.

The songs were great though and the songs the dwarves were singing were good fun, too.  Gal Gadot was a beautiful evil stepmother and the plain Snow White will give the average girl the hope that one day they too could be a princess, which is definitely a positive. 

An unimaginative film, that will soon be forgotten.  Perhaps not, though.  Perhaps it will be infamous as the raspberry that it is.

Disney - if it isn't broken, then don't fix it.  Work on new scripts.  Show us something we haven't seen before.  You're starting to lose your touch...","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

We (all) watch Disney movies BECAUSE of the comforting good feeling of bringing us back in time. We introduce our kids to Disney classics because they are classics. 

They went way too far.  Girls are entitled to want their true love to be a prince. We are entitled to like romance.  We are entitled to sing with the birds while cleaning our house because it’s something that we enjoy doing.  We are entitled to a gold bed in a glass dome. We want to be cherished and not just to be expected to do it all and save it all at all times.

The biggest letdown, however, is how the film tries too hard to modernize the story without understanding what made it timeless in the first place. The lead performance is lackluster, with little emotional range, and the chemistry between characters feels forced. Instead of a whimsical and enchanting journey, we’re left with a lifeless retelling that neither honors the original nor offers anything fresh or exciting.

Overall, Snow White fails to deliver the magic, charm, or even basic entertainment value that audiences expect.

Snow White has long black hair according to the original drawing in the book of the Brothers Grimm. When she discovered the house of the seven dwarfs she tries some of the tiny meals, drinks and all the beds. The last bed is comfortable and she falls asleep. She lives with the seven dwarfs and there is no mention of her looking for her father. Also in the original, the queen has actually three attempts, when she goes to see Snow White at the house of the seven dwarfs - one with a comb, one with a laced bodice and last with the apple. The Queen is even eating half of the apple (that is not poisoned) After falling into a coma the dwarfs put her into a glass coffin which later a prince on a hunting trip finds and wants to bring to her resting place in her father's castle. He's captured by her Beauty. One of his servants trips which dialogues the stuck piece of apple in Snow Whites throat and she awakes. There is no kiss. 
The end of the story is wrong as well. I don't like the movie at all. The actress who plays Snow White, her performance is not good which makes it worse.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

First off, Snow White is supposed to be a contralto-soprano, and they just threw that out the window. Her voice in the original was so distinct and added to her charm, but here? Nope. She didn’t have that same warmth or ethereal quality, which made her way less captivating. And the storyline? It didn’t feel like a fairy tale anymore. Instead of embracing what made Snow White iconic, they gutted the originality and replaced it with something that felt like a preachy, watered-down version of a Disney movie. It was like they were scared to let the story just be what it was meant to be. The one thing I did love? The Evil Queen the acting choices for her were on point, and she was honestly more interesting than Snow White herself. Overall, this remake was a letdown. They took a classic and overcomplicated it, losing the magic in the process. But hey, at least the Evil Queen did great.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

I actually felt more engaged and immersed in the underrated but actually amazing, Nicolas Cage movie. Willy’s Wonderland. That movie had everything that this movie doesn’t have.

Beyond the casting, the movie itself lacked the magic and charm of the original. The writing felt uninspired, the visuals were lackluster, and the overall execution left a lot to be desired.

For a film with such a big budget, it’s shocking how lifeless it all feels. Disney clearly tried to reinvent the story, but in doing so, they lost everything that made it special. Save your money and rewatch the original instead.","You and 31 other people found this helpful.","31 people found this helpful."

On top of all that, the film looks cheap, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the whole thing feels like a lazy cash grab. Disney should be ashamed of this one.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Zegler’s performance felt less like Snow White and more like Snow “Whatever, I Deserve Better.” It’s hard to root for a character when the actress looks like she’d rather be anywhere else, preferably on a stage giving a TED Talk about how she’s above it all.

I thought this rendition had very good messaging, on old familiar story presented in a more contemporary light. The messaging resounded as especially encouraging at this time. Despite obvious stereotyping, perhaps part of the story to embrace just as the audience is asked to relate to the villagers and to look more deeply and not simply judge a book by its cover, this movie strode past conceptual limitations and came across to me as a pretty great film.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Snow White is a soprano, which is a very high octave. Disney should’ve casted a person who has a good octave range to play her, they did not and they casted an alto. Not much of a difference but it bothered me. Snow White is also a dainty woman. She was saved by a man, she depended on men for a while. Though the actress decided to scratch that out of her character. I don’t know if this was Disney’s idea, or hers, but she seems to be too strong. Like all the newer princesses. I wish she was more like the original. The second point previously stated was that they don’t cast dwarfs to play the seven dwarfs. Dwarfs are underpowered in the media. They used ai to make dwarfs and then cgi’d them into the movie. It shows how they didn’t care for all minorities, just some that will say: “hey! Disney loves us!” And promote their content. The third reason is the acting. Their acting was.. let’s say not the best. It was too strong emotion then too weak. It was cringey, but not in a good way. Snow White could’ve been better if those three things were done better.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

This new version made her bitter and cold, like being rude equals power. I get wanting to make her more modern, but this went too far in the opposite direction. Snow White wasn’t powerful because she was loud—she was powerful because she stayed kind even when things were hard. That’s what made her inspiring.

Even the visuals didn’t help. The CGI felt awkward, and the dwarfs lost all their charm and personality. Everything just felt flat and empty, like the magic had been taken out.

I’m not against reimagining classics, but if you’re going to change the entire tone, character, and meaning of the story, then why call it Snow White? It’s disappointing because it could’ve been something beautiful—but instead, it just lost the heart that made the original timeless.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Great adaptation, so sad to know it was a flop me and my family thoroughly enjoyed it.

I went into the theatre expecting it to be a train wreck, but nothing could prepare me for  what I saw.

Let’s just say this, anyone who gave this film 5 stars is in someway connected to this bag of vomit and is trying desperately to balance out the IMDB rating of a dwarfly 2.4/10.

Disney really needs to stop poorly remaking their classic films. Just look what’s happened to Tesla through boycotting. Don’t think for a second you’re above that.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Overall, the entire film came across as forced and awkward, as if it was trying too hard to modernize the classic tale without truly understanding what made the original so compelling.

The costumes looked cheap and gaudy. A ploy to sell toys. I don't know how to feel about the dwarves as they were hardly there, which could have been a good thing as the CGI was comical at best. The queen didn't scare me. And the story read as if it was someone who knew nothing of the fairy tale or original movie. Definitely not worth a watch, much less a rewatch.

Singing was great from Rachel Zegler. I kind of wish it had the original softness from the original Snow White. They could have used real people for the Seven Dwarves.

I had high hopes for Snow White (2025), but unfortunately, it fell short in many ways. While the visuals were impressive and the production quality was high, the movie lacked the charm and magic of the original. The changes to the story and characters felt unnecessary and took away from the timeless appeal of the classic fairy tale.

The performances were decent, but the writing and pacing made it hard to stay engaged. Some of the dialogue felt forced, and the overall tone was inconsistent. It seemed like the movie was trying too hard to modernize the story rather than staying true to what made Snow White so beloved in the first place.

If you’re a fan of the original, you might find this version disappointing. It’s not the worst movie, but it’s certainly not the remake we were hoping for.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

The film completely lacks the magic and charm of the original, replacing it with a dull, uninspired story that feels forced rather than heartfelt.

Making Snow White a Hispanic-looking character doesn’t feel like real representation — it feels like we’re being thrown a bone instead of being offered our own strong, meaningful stories. As a Mexican woman, I don’t need to be inserted into a fairy tale rooted in another culture just to feel seen. I need authentic stories that reflect who we are.

The facial expressions were hilariously awful and I’m talking about the people not the CGI dwarves. 
I gotta be honest it was worse than I imagined, though I was (but then again I wasn’t) shocked that they allowed her to actually fall in love.

I haven’t even seen but I can feel the shitness of it and of the Rachel Zegler. Disney needs to stop Changing the storylines of their original movies. 0/10 do NOT recommend I’d rather watch Tennis or smt 💀 1/5 stars bc 0 stars isn’t possible.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

The music the dancing The songs. I love that. This movie was super perfect. And it doesn't deserve all this hate. If the kids love it, then let them love it. Stop hating on this movie. It was absolutely amazing. And the best part of the movie was when they gave my adorable dopey a voice.

If you think Ziegler's social media persona is bad, wait till you get a load of her acting. I've seen better acting from a drunk taking a breathalyzer. She's horrible. Fortunately, since we left less than half way through, we got a refund. And fyi, it was our grandkids idea to leave. All four of them. Ages 4-7. They hated it. Any good reviews are only there to mislead and get you to support the 'agenda'.

Where do I start ? The CGI Dwarfs are just creepy looking. So many loveable actors did not get the opportunity to play such an iconic role. I wasn't sure where the story line was actually going. It did stray away from the original plot of the 1939 film. The films young star learned a hard lesson and it's to keep politics and your job separate.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

This movie is Godawful! DEI has ruined an otherwise cult-classic story. Rachel Zegler is totally unacceptable as the titular character. Just her vocals were good. Gal Gadot was absolutely misplaced. The prince looks so irrelevant.

Don't waste your money booking tickets for this excuse of a movie.

The songs were terrible and there was so much animation why is it called live action? Animating the dwarves took real jobs away from little people actors (bad move).
