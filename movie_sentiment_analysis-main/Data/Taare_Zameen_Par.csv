The story follows Ishaan Awasthi, an 8-year-old boy (played brilliantly by Darsheel Safary), whose unique perspective and struggles with traditional schooling lead him to feel misunderstood and isolated. When an empathetic art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan), enters his life, he helps Ishaan and his family understand the challenges of dyslexia, showing that every child learns differently.

Darsheel Safary's performance as Ishaan is nothing short of extraordinary. He portrays the child’s frustration, wonder, and sensitivity with such depth that it’s impossible not to empathize with him. Aamir Khan delivers a subtle yet powerful performance as the teacher who encourages Ishaan to embrace his unique abilities rather than conform to the system.

The film’s narrative is heartfelt, delivering a message that promotes awareness and understanding of learning disabilities while celebrating each child’s individuality. With touching songs like ""Maa"" and ""Taare Zameen Par,"" the soundtrack by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy adds emotional depth, perfectly capturing the film’s themes.

Overall, Taare Zameen Par is a must-watch, not only for parents and educators but for anyone who believes in the importance of empathy and acceptance. It is a heartwarming, inspirational film that sheds light on the impact of compassionate teaching, making it an unforgettable cinematic experience.","You and 8 other people found this helpful.","8 people found this helpful."

The turning point comes when a new art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, enters his life. He understands Ishaan’s struggles, encourages his creativity, and helps him gain confidence.

 What uplifts this film is the way it moves you deeply with its sterling performances. 
All in all, it is a magical film about the magnificent abilities children have, even when all the odds are against them. Luckily, most of the Bollywood clichés actually enhance the film experience. Being such an integral part of the story, the soundtrack and score complement the film wonderfully. Each song aligning nicely with the film's dramatic but hopeful tone. 

""There have been such gems amongst us, who changed the course of the world because they could look at the world differently. Their thinking was unique and not everyone understood them. They were opposed, yet they emerged winners and the world was amazed.""

 Aamir Khan has captured these emotions perfectly near the end of  Taare Zameen Par (a.k.a Like Stars on Earth). I don't think I'll ever get the image of Ishaan's father breaking down into tears out of my head. There's some really powerful stuff here.

well. The film was a great commercial success. The story is simple and connects immediately with every child and adult in the auditorium and has a profound emotional impact on the audience. However, it is hard to believe that the child was performing so badly in academics and still his parents failed to discover the actual reason behind it. 
Also, towards the climax, the movie seems to be in a hurry to wrap up.

The cinematography is excellent. All emotions have been captured by the camera very well. The music by Shankar-

*Taare Zameen Par* isn’t just a film; it’s a poignant journey that tugs at your heartstrings. Directed by Aamir Khan, this film beautifully captures the story of Ishaan, an 8-year-old boy with dyslexia, who sees the world through a lens of wonder and creativity. While his brilliance goes unnoticed by his family and teachers, his struggle to meet societal expectations leaves him feeling lost and misunderstood. 

Enter Ram Shankar Nikumbh (played by Aamir Khan), a compassionate art teacher who recognizes Ishaan’s unique gifts and, through patience and empathy, helps him unlock his true potential. The film's message is clear: every child is special in their own way, and it’s the responsibility of society to nurture their talents instead of pushing them into rigid molds.

The storytelling is tender, and the performances are raw and real. Darsheel Safary, as Ishaan, delivers a performance that is both heartbreaking and uplifting. The soundtrack, with songs like ""Maa"" and ""Taare Zameen Par,"" elevates the emotional depth of the film, making it impossible to hold back tears.

Aamir Khan’s direction is sensitive and powerful, highlighting issues that many overlook. It’s a film that speaks to parents, teachers, and students alike, urging us to embrace differences and celebrate individuality.

No matter how many years roll by this movie will remain in my heart forever. 

The depiction of a child's wild imagination and innocence. The way society kills the amazing possibility of genius thoughts through imposing a regimented lifestyle on kids. 

The portrayal of helplessness of Ishan and how suffocating it can be for a little soul, how Nikumbh gave him space to heal and trust himself again is truly remarkable. 💚


When you see that despite of Ishan trying his best to survive , the adults kept on traumatizing the kid untill he completely loses his self confidence and happiness.
Have you noticed how anxious ishan got initially when he experiences applause for the first time. 
We need more emotionally intelligent people like Nikumbh who makes this world better and brighter with their light. 🤍


I loved every bit of it. The movie touches your heart, it questions your learned belief about society's standards. It makes you emotionally aware. This movie is beautiful throughout, it also has fun elements and heartwarming songs with meaningful lyrics. 💙

The acting is extremely good and I don’t think I’ve cried seeing films but this one is different. I literally got emotional and felt like my heart was aching when ishaans parents were scolding him.

As long as I saw the movie I got lost because I got so well connected to the situation therein that, most of the times I found myself in it.  I got deeply involved as I saw Ishaan (portrayed by Darsheel Safary) in the film.

The film brings out the ground reality of how the world looks at children who suffer from dyslexia.  The way Amir Khan (the Director and Producer) has brought out a clear message to the world (not to ignore the simple joys and pleasures of Kids and not to rob them of their childhood life) is simply amazing.  The 8 year old kid Ishaan is good at art but is a slow learner and poor in academics.  

Like any usual and normal parents, Ishaan’s parents too always prioritise homework, marks and neatness. Ishaan on the other hand always dreams of colours, fish, kites and dogs etc. He spends most days punished outside class letting his imagination go around the world.  At home, he is always seen mixing colours, painting away instead of doing his homework.  While his elder brother is very good at studies and sports, Ishaan is quite opposite.  His poor scores in academics becomes a cause of concern to the parents.  Unaware of the reason behind of his weakness, his parents admit him to a boarding school for disciplining him.  Here, the art teacher (Nikumbh) identifies the problem and rises to the occasion to help him to overcome his disability.  Amir Khan, who has cast the Art Teacher’s role has excelled in his role play.

The film has been well edited by Deepa Bhatia.  The Lyrics of the songs are written by Prasoon Joshi, which are too good.  The picturisation of the entire film and especially the song sequences are exceptionally so good that even rock hearted people who would not drop tears would be moved and experience emotions. The title song is fascinating. Maa and Jame Raho combine talents in all respects- music, words and voice. The production design is superb. Not even for a moment you feel anything is fake. 

The picturisation of school sequences is so good. To make things as natural as possible, the Editor has worked hard.  He has involved in a few of the real students of the school.   In fact, a share in the success of the film can be credited to these students too who have justified their involvement in the film.
Bogged down by the routine action films which hardly make any impact on our lives, I would rate this film with a 4.5 score out of 5 and would strongly recommend to film lovers that this is a NOT TO BE MISSED MOVIE.  Let me also add “DO NOT BE CARRIED AWAY BY A FEW POSTERS AND THINK THAT THIS IS A CHILDREN’S FILM.  NO IT IS NOT.  IF YOU HAVENT SEEN IT SO FAR DO IT NOW”.","You and 325 other people found this helpful.","325 people found this helpful."

Everytime I watch this one, it never fails to make me tear up a bit. 

The movie has brilliant characterization, plot, social message, art, and music as well. Emotionally, this film is in a whole new league. 

The message of the film is simple: ""every kid is special and is like a star on earth. Do not compare kids and make it difficult for them because everyone has different abilities/strengths and weaknesses.""

The film also highlights the need for parental love and how support from close ones is very necessary for kids' development.

I felt like it was about me, although I wasn't dyslexic, but I was 'an astronaut' and this movie seems to have captured and portrayed the gist of the way I felt as a school kid.

I appreciate the fact that they chose to convey such an important message, a perspective even, that can actually make a change.

The main character of the kid is brilliantly played by the actor Darsheel Safary. His acting is so convincing that I empathized with him and was deeply immersed in the film.

Aamir played a role, quite similar to that which he played in the movie ""3 idiots"" - which I enjoyed very much. A man that reads between the lines, values other people without discrimination, and acts upon what he believes. I find him very inspirational, and he's the reason that I watched this movie after enjoying him at ""3 idiots"".","You and 14 other people found this helpful.","14 people found this helpful."

It has been released in 2007 when I was eleven year old and was in 8th standard. Then I wasn't even know about movies.
This movie is my new favourite and will be always.
Today It’s like I'm seeing myself in mirror after many of years.
Darshil has done amazing acting in that small age and Amir is phenomenal. First time I love amir this much, as firstly liked his three idiots. Today I just fall for him and his acting. Whole day I was praising him and his acting. 
Music is just so enchanting and exceptional. Love all songs. 
Now here why this movie touch my heart so hardly and make a place in the depth.
Ishaan and Amir both were part of a single character that I've been played in my life.
Ishaan was my childhood who had face so much difficulties especially in study and going school. So today if I see a child as reflection of mine then I get attached or over think and sometimes worried about them.
Our misfortune is we called extraordinary as abnormal. Whom needs inspiration, appreciation they get only anger, hate and sometimes sympathy. 
Our misfortune is we don't have teachers like Nikumbh in reality. We do struggle and fight all with our own from the world full of normality. But even the biggest supporters can be their families or parents.","You and 96 other people found this helpful.","96 people found this helpful."

This movie may as be listed in the genre horror because it is painful to watch and be MA15+ because young children would be scarred for life. Blood scenes would scare young children and abuse scenes are frightening. Also a very depressing movie and bad camera movements.

Countless physical abuse and blood scenes would cripple the mind and destroy your childhood. Especially injustice of the father belting Ishaan across the face like a deranged psychopath. It will spread abuse before you know it. Not an ideal movie for kids at all! 

This abhorrent movie features a depressed boy who won’t be happy no matter how many people try to cheer him up, he is just a sad person in general. It made everybody sad and glum. Never did you see Him smile till the end, about time! These days the boy who played him is as ugly as a troll.

Yes, this movie features a boy that has dyslexia which just showcases the dark and sad side of the world. Also, the camera angles and camera movement would cause dyslexia! The movie must’ve been filmed it on an iPhone it was so bad! No wonder Hollywood earns more money than the humiliation Bollywood.

Who should we feel sorrier for, the director or the cast, oh wait both because not only did the director have to watch this nightmare but experience it as a cast member! This movie only earned 800 million which was beaten by other movies in less than a day.

No Hollywood movie made nowadays can produce such a human film. Sincerity has long left LA LA Land. It's very assuring to find such films in Bollywood.

Watch It Please. Especially if you have or know of children struggling in school. CARE for them and remind them that are stars with limitless potential.

In many southeastern countries, societal pressures and the consistent presence of stigmas cause many parents to have a single-minded approach to education and other aspects of their child's life. Though this may not always be what the parent wants to impose upon the child, it is what they do, as they do not want their child to fail in a society that is formed around the very same belief. So if you think about it, these families are consistently feeding into a ruthless and unforgiving way of life that they themselves don't want their children to fall harm to.

Even when a true star falls among us and shines , due to the blindness of apparent perfection we actually ignore its light initially. Indeed, we need a mentor to show us the light.

The good thing is that my wife and I are aware off her situation, we are home schooling her and she is happy, learning and very positive.

I understood what that boy felt even at a younger age (Director's creativity) and I still remember crying at the end.
Now, after *15 YEARS* I watched it again. Bro.. I was literally sobbing.
i could feel myself in Ishan's place. I related to everything that guy went through.The director's vision was way beyond the time at which he created this masterpiece. at the end i was out of tissues. Beautiful movie.

Especially it is difficult to understand, when a child looks visually like any other child, the child’s behavior. 
For awhile after birth the child is thought of as a behavior problem, and disciplined as such. Dad is often angry and harsh. Mom feels protective of her child, knows her child is not bad but misunderstood. She is frustrated and depressed, but loving too. 
The child is angry, depressed, confused and feels isolated. As such, the child acts out in socially unacceptable ways and has low achievement scores. 
My husband’s and my reactions and emotions were the same as in this movie with our “perfect looking” firstborn who had special needs. 
Our child’s responses were exactly the same as the child in this story. 
This movie is an unforgettable, unique masterpiece. 
Also it shines light on this problem and brings awareness to society. 
This is a “must watch” film.","You and 7 other people found this helpful.","7 people found this helpful."

I am sure many parents have benefitted themselves from this movie and the greatest benefiters are the children who can be understood now by their parents.","You and 9 other people found this helpful.","9 people found this helpful."

Really they have given true message that world is comparative . Now a days students suffer from mental depression main cause is education pressure.  People think in society that if we don't become doctor engineer or pilot nobody is going to give us respect. Our Indians mentality is very bad. Infact now a days schools teachers humiliate a lot specially of weak students they never deiscuss them about there problems. They will use humiliating words to those weak students like useless huamn being cowdung . And classmates will make fun of him .  So it's better to study  at home only. Iast scene was very emotional when he was crying  that chid name is darshal safari his character name was Ishan Avasthi. These is known as hardwork willpower dedication. Really education system in India is bad. I don't that why school authority give jobs like these kinds of ill-mannered teacher's that don't have humanity self respect on other's dosnt have feelings. They should be thrown out from schools. I really hate these kinds of Teachers. I don't respect them.","You and 52 other people found this helpful.","52 people found this helpful."
